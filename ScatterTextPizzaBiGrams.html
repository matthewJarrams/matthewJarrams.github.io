the location and they took my name and came back with the wrong order i said no i did not order two medium pizzas i ordered pizzas potatoes wings etc i gave her my name again and they looked but had no clue who i was i asked if they were sure and they said yes so i left called customer service while i drove because i was late to my destination and sam looked into the order double checked the correct location and called them to check they said yes we have his pizza i thanked sam and informed him that i had left he apologized and canceled the order from me and then attached a curly fries to my next order in the future", "my family and i always order double pepperoni and extra sauce for one pizza and donair for the other most often we get the pizza from this location but when we do there is close to one pepperoni per slice the donair pizza looked like it had two pieces of meat on the entire thing its almost like the person responsible for doing this thinks if they add the toppings the customer asks and pays for that it will be a bad thing perhaps they think each additional topping will be deducted from their pay i do not know why they constantly do that but i would like to start receiving the pizza we ask for and not what some cheap half wit pizza maker thinks is what i want definitely do not recommend this location until they learn to listen and act", "i order delivery from

minutes and he did not show up so i went back upstairs to my apartment i open my order and realize its hawaiian pizza and i do not eat pork anyways the driver calls me after an hour am when i was sleeping hungry", "not a it fan of pizza but their wings are always good until well yesterday i also tried their poutine and yucky gravy is not enough thick and gross and cheese well not enough considering they are using wedges and our wings were disappointing they were not tossed in sauce just sprayed with a sauce bottle not the way wings are ment to be as well as the size was a disappointment pizza usually have really great wings now i am not so sure", "i ordered the medium mega meal from this location on january th i got a ham and pineapple pizza and a chicken and roasted tomato pizza with the golden crispy wings i receive my order from the delivery guy go to eat it and its nasty pizza is rubbery and chewy and had barely any sauce wings are spicy and they look like they have been sitting under a heat lamp for days old and nasty i call customer service and they offer to send a replacement i get the replacement and once again its nasty and its the same exact issue i will no longer be ordering from this pizza again absolutely disgusting i have never had an issue with this location before i should have just gotten my money back", "my family and i order from here quite abit and usually its good but the last two times last weekend and today its been lower quality and its just not what i am asking for double pepperoni means just that its pretty easy to follow and understand i would think one to two pepperoni per slice after asking for double is insulting to say the least i am strongly considering not using this location anymore due their lack of satisfying their customer and worrying about a few extra pepperoni shutting the business down listen to your customers and aim to please or get out of the business altogether this would be the third time now this exact thing has happened", "probably the worst bps low quality food and service they definitely use hot dog water ice cubes", "first and foremost i am a new baby vegan and have not consumed egg or dairy or meat for almost months now i know i know tell me about it i dined here on and asked my server about vegan options she went over the menu with me and i decided on a bowl of the mediterranean vegetable bow tie pasta sans pesto and cheese it arrived it was hot and delicious and filling i paid and left a couple hours later i ended up feeling quite sick and i wondered if it could have been something to do with my food so i googled the nutritional information and found out that my pasta had egg in the pasta noodles and dairy in the sauce my waitress lied to me i know its not that big of a deal i am not allergic or anything but come on if you are not sure about the menu ask if i could give stars i would never again bps", "boyfriend and i went to this location the other day and i have to say it was not my favourite experience the waitress was alright not amazing but not horrible she had a bad habit of just leaving us for minutes at a time randomly the food is why i am giving this place two stars my boyfriend ordered pasta and i ordered a chicken sandwich they give massive portions which i like however it seems like they are dead set on drowning every dish they serve because my side caesar salad had just too much dressing my boyfriends pasta was more like a stew or a thick soup there was so much sauce he was really upset about it and hes not even the type of person to be picky about food i offered to bring it up for him to our waitress but he insisted that i just leave it alone we paid our bill and tipped then left a little disappointed do not think we will be returning to this bps location again the quality of food is not as good as some of them i have been to the whyte ave location was much better", "you can drink here and have appetizers or pizza but i suggest you order entrees elsewhere steak sandwich was overcooked with way too much bread and way too much dressing on caesar salad no garnish broccoli soup too creamy washrooms felt dirty but staff were pleasant we sat in the pub side has a nice sports pub i would only return for drinks maybe salads it has tv screens and good street view in pub", "go back do the dragons den this boston pizza should be revamped overcooked food dirty and discussing", "horrible experience with their take out delivery service ordered more than times and not once was the order similar experience when dining in not to mention we got to experience the oh so chipper and happy staff eager to fix their mistakes and happy to do so not i am done with boston pizza i know that they do not need my business but there are so many other better options out there have not been in months and have never looked back", "i have never had any of the problems that the other reviews have talked about we go to this location all the time have pretty great service and great food only one mess up my pasta was once baked with cheese no big deal its reasonably fast and affordable when we order delivery yes it does take the full min they say it will but our food is always hot and delicious and the man who delivers knows us pretty well now and is really nice its a great place to go when i do not want to cook or when its late post homework and we have got the munchies or just want to play cards reliable comforting and predictable", "this is the worst boston pizza in the city everyone knows you go to bps because you know the menu no surprises the food is pretty consistent and you are usually going to get served fairly quickly and efficiently walking into this location i noticed immediately that the place was a mess there was food all over the floor tables were not cleared and it just looked gross the waitress sat us down and there was pop on the table and pizza crust on the seat what so we requested a new table the waitress seemed miffed about this but moved us we waited forever to be asked if we wanted drinks and that was it id had enough i rarely if ever have walked out of a restaurant but this was it we walked out and wrote to bps about the service never to hear back i really do not think this location gives a f never going back", "oh boston pizza how you have been there for me in the past when i have needed a late night snack or am too lazy to make dinner for myself and a pizza saves the day i do not expect a lot from you really you are not high end you cater to a family atmosphere and you are as casual as casual can get however when i order a delivery and they say it is going to be minutes i expect that there will no shenanigans with my order maybe it was because my order was small that they did not take it seriously only a full order of wings and cheese bread did i want and after waiting the full minutes for my order the store finally called to let us know that the driver was downstairs i went down right away to find no one there maybe they had gotten the building wrong we called back to the store and they said that the driver was there but no one came down so he left on another delivery apparently he had also called us several times to let us know he was there hmmm i think not we were so close to cancelling our order but was assured he would be back in minutes he was back in just as we were about to call again and cancel our order the food was surprisingly still warm hence saving this restaurant from a star rating on my next boston pizza craving i will have to find another store so sad", "i usually come here on late nights with my boyfriend the pizza is pretty good but appetizers are average at night the restaurant is quiet and service is quick so well usually go at like midnight after hanging out with people and just relax and read the paper together", "incredibly long wait times for delivery overpriced and terrible customer service i will be crossing this particular boston pizza location heritage off my list of regular go tos for ordering in the last straw was last week when i placed an order waited over an hour and a half for it to arrive and then noticed my order was incomplete i was charged for some items i did not receive the bill clearly states i was charged for the items so i immediately called the location and spoke with a manager who seemed as if she could care less perhaps because my order was small it does not matter i am a regular customer and at times in the past i have visited the location and the bill was large not any more anyway she asked me what do you want me to do about it what do i want her to do about it how should i know what my options are why did not she tell me what she could do about it i asked for the items to be delivered but was told it would be another hour and a half for it to arrive no acknowledgement of the mistake being on their end no apology and rather rude as if it was me causing the inconvenience disappointed i told them to forget it the next day i wrote the head offices of boston pizza and was directed back to the restaurant for follow up within two business days and surprise surprise they never followed up i have since written the main office back two times telling them this was not followed up and now they do not seem to be responding either very disappointing for shame boston pizza i thought you valued your customers more than that this location should look at new management or closing their doors i certainly will not be visiting them in person or through delivery again", "horrible customer service always wait minutes to receive a hello andor a menu wait another for a drink and an even longer wait time for the food nobody ever checks in to see how were doing or how the food is and at this point everything is almost finished or cold when we tried to speak to the manager she ignored us been in the service industry for years this is not how you treat customers ps i am saying this about the pub the dining room is a whole other story", "the waitstaff is friendly enough but they took my boyfriends drink before he finished we saw our waitress twice someone else had to bring is our food it was fairly cold and the second time we saw our waitress it was because she was ushered over by the girl who brought us our food we also had to get another waitress to grab us our bill really slow service go to the canadian brew house right next door way way better service and better food", "i feel bad not doing a star review for boston because for years and years it was my favorite place to get pizza i have never tried this particular location but i found boston pizza is usually consistient from restraunt to restraunt the pizza i got the other night was very good but it cost me dollars and i am going to i got enough pizza for about meals tops for dollars per meal it ought to be very good my big beef and the reason i am not doing or stars is the horrible service i got i called ahead to have a pizza ready for pickup when i got there they had no order for me it was not just slow they had no order at all it was supper hour they were busy but i did not get any sense that they cared about me she seemed embarrassed she could not find the ticket but more for herself i do not think i heard that they were sorry i sure as hell did not hear any offer of compensation for my time i called ahead so i would not have to wait then i had to wait there was no offer of a drink while i waited no offer of a discount the pizza was good the pizza is always good it was not dollars worth of good though i will not be going back for awhile maybe not at all if royal or fameso do a good job when i try them out sometime later this month sorry boston good pizza but it will take more then that to keep my business if you insist on charging dollars for a large great white north with italian sausage", "i have to say that i think this boston pizza needs to close down there are much nicer and busier locations south common and calgary trail pretty close to this one and the ave location is clearly suffering i have not had a very good experience here in years it used to be one of my favorite places to go for dinner with my best friend but not any more the food is pretty much the same at all locations but the service varies i find that the morale of this store is contagious and it just brings me down because everyone there is so down instead of checking to see if my food tastes ok the servers sit and talk to the bartender as if they did not have any responsibility at all i just get a bad vibe from this place now and i have to say they do not know how to make a decent caesar here i always order one hoping someone has finally showed them to do it properly but i am always disappointed serves me right for continuing to order them i would recommend the calgary trail boston pizza if you are looking for a good bps", "i pulled over here in winter time ordered a salad and a pizza and it was freaking delicious the service was ok unfortunately there is a lot of screaming families and rowdiness but the food at this location is really good", "solid bp location usually bp is a star for me but the bar service here made all three of my non alcoholic quenchers beautifully with fresh fruit just like advertised many bps i go to do not put in the mango slice or blackberries as pictured our service was a bit slow but to be fair it was a slammed friday night the kids love the new stackable crayons and kids bookmenu has a board game fun for the whole family my son was disappointed that burgers are no longer on the kids menu the spicy memphis kickin chicken was spicy and so good see you soon bp see you soon", "where to start for a plate of nachos and a large cheese pizza and a round of drinks root beer a tea and a couple of chocolate milks for the kids took about minutes to get the pizza which i could see if the place was busy but there was only tables seated yes i said pizza st because that is what came st blazing hot too i may add out of of us were burnt by the sauce the nachos came about minutes later served people but comes with a cup of salsa and sour cream when asked for more salsa and sour cream for the table it was added to the bill of course the nachos were stone cold drowning in cilantro i have had better nachos from at in the morning i am not shocked by this i never had liked bps i have never had good food there and never will as this last experience was the straw", "should have read the reviews before i went into here went in during supper around pm was seated watched all the waitresses waiters serve we sat there for min not one person came to our table even to give water we were shocked other staff saw us sitting waitresses walked by our table and nobody came i was not about to chase down staff so min sitting at a booth in the restaurant half full nobody acknowledged us i would have to say that is a first in any restaurant for me we just got up and left the guy at the front door cleaning that sat us looked puzzled and i told him we been sitting all this time nobody knows we are in the restaurant not even a hi we will be with you never setting foot in this boston pizza was a joke do not go here what a waste of time go to windermere boston pizza they actually have style there", "have been here many times as i have been living in this area for several years i have always ordered the same food their pasta jambalaya and was satisfied their staff have always been nice never had any issues with their service their place is not the most clean but its not disgusting either i am leaving this review based on my recent experience with trying their mvp hamburger i have to say that was the most disgusting hamburger i have ever had in my life i would pay that price for mcdonalds hamburger anytime but would not even pay a dollar for that hamburger it was not just tasteless it had a taste that left me and my friend feeling sick all night we had the cactus fries on the side and half of those fries were soggy based on this experience i will be staying away from this place for a long while just to get the disgusting taste of that food out of my mouth", "rating this on my order experience for take out i have sat in and had food or drinks in the part thus deciding to go with the takeout strategy as my head was hurting already and did not want to bring on a migraine from a loud environment however its been so long since i have been to this location i did not realize one needed to walk through the whole restaurant to the back to make your order of course you need to be taken back by staff as you are half in the kitchen if you go that way i was not the only one looking confused as there was another person there to order being led back while i was leaving the space when placing my order with the gift certificate i got checking in at the most previous yelp elite event thanks bp the waitress was polite knowledgeable about what i could order with the coupon and very honest about how busy it was as i walked in on valentines night i did find it a bit odd that i was not given a number or order receipt but told id be given that when i return and to come back in or more minutes she also did not take my phone number again a bit odd as i know that is pretty standard for takeouts anywhere else i did look out the walk up door that is specific for takeout orders i determined with my mobility issues having to be guided through the restaurant to the back was better than struggling to get up to the door and when driving to the gas station i could not tell if that door access would allow parking nearby before i went burnt time doing random errands close by bank gas station are both super close i stopped at the washroom it was in need of some maintenance not the worst situation i have seen but i would have brought it someone is attention if anyone would have been at the front when i was walking out the main doors pick up went as smoothly as it could i came back before the minutes were up and i am glad i did as it looked like orders were piling up with the amount of receipts on the counter before going to the back i of course needed to wait to get someone to walk me back there as that is what they instructed me to do when i returned and then watched them search for my name as there was no receipt number to give them lucky for me my cane is memorable and she knew which pizza was mine when she found it with them handling a ton of takeout orders and the coziness of the small pick up standing area i am a bit puzzled this is not better organized i managed to get around the person for skip the dish through the passageway without my pizza box needing to be tipped vertically or tripping him with my cane hurray for both of us i definitely do not recommend standing in there for an order when there is more than two as that is a small space to try and maneuver past others leaving with orders pizza was the same tasty great white north i remembered and i really do enjoy the heart pizza being that its valentines this week that really does make a person feel special i had lots of left overs which was great as this week was a busy one in summary ill probably continue my once in a blue moon bp locations inout of the city because of older family member requests if i am being honest the restaurant does not matter location is not really something id enjoy sitting there by myself for a meal it does the trick when you are travelling and need a quick bite i am not a big sports fan nor can i enjoy an alcoholic drink so i would not enjoy sitting in the lounge in the evenings which is about the same noise level as a full restaurant waiting for my order either as there is other pizza spots for take out without having to walk that far twice or worry if ill actually get what i ordered ill probably go else where or just get the pizza delivered to me directly if i really had a craving for a great white north pizza", "my girlfriend and i ate there last night the food was cold and the staff was even colder each time our beer was empty we had to call the waitress over for a refill the staff did not seem at all concerned with the patrons they were more concerned with having fun with each other our waitress made it seem like an inconvenience to check with us on food or drink i usually enjoy going to boston pizza this is the second time we have been to this location and it will be the last time we will still go to bps but not to the century park lica", "my girlfriend and i ate there last night the food was cold and the staff was even colder each time our beer was empty we had to call the waitress

"great little find right by the hotel we stayed in the service was prompt and very friendly the salad was delicious very clean nice atmosphere i was not disappointed", "if you plan to dine al fresco be aware that a red arrow bus depot is next door and is busy with at least one idling bus at the supper hour i had the sea food linguini which was no big deal the shrimp were over cooked they no longer had the chocolate mousse and were out of pecan pie so i settled for the strawberry cheesecake which is also not memorable there might be great items on the menu but i do not think ill be back to try find out the service however was fine", "great italian food the seafood linguini is definitely one of the best i have ever tasted flavourful sauce", "was headed back to calgary on the red arrow so decided to try villa bistro before heading to the bus ordered the caesar salad you could immediately tell if was freshly made the chicken was warm and tender seasoned perfectly service was excellent and welcoming the salad took a bit longer than expected to arrive that is on me so had to gobble it down in a hurry would have much rather taken time to enjoy perhaps next trip enjoyed the first experience here and look forward to a return visit", "excellent food and great customer service at villa had a great time with friends and felt the decore and atmosphere was very appropriate definitely will be back and recommend to others i have never heard of this place until i found out about it through a friend", "had an amazing dinner at villa bistro last night with friends the baked brie with blueberry compote lamp pops and salmon avocado toast were absolutely incredible i will most definitely be back thank you keltie and rui for your wonderful hospitality", "checked out this place because it was part of the downtown harvest dining event taken place in edmonton i wanted to check it out because it is a fairly newish restaurant with not too much fanfare attached to it it was pleasant enough in the inside it had rather warm interior one thing i did not like was that there are not any interior bathrooms rather you need to remember a code and take it to hallway this is not convenient but not completely a deal breaker our server was pleasant enough and left us with menus even though we were ordering off of a special menu glancing at the menu it had nothing standoutish but a good selection of burgers sandwiches appetizers and main entrees we ordered a squash soup as well as a cream of mushroom i had the cajun salmon while my husband chose the braised short rib i have to say the food was amazing possibly one of the best cream of mushroom soups i have tried my own butternut squash soup was rich and warming my trout was perfectly cooked the generous portion was plated on top of fried mushroom quinoa and perfectly cooked asparagus i loved how they prepared the quinoa the frying gave an additional crunch my husbands short ribs were flake off the fork tender definitively worth trying out", "good swiss burger and fabulous fries local apricot beer was a good choice with it surprised by how good it was friendly staff very quiet place on a monday night", "quaint corner bistro on street located around the corner from the holiday express inn in the heart of downtown edmonton today was a bitterly cold day with extreme wind chills so the desire to wander far for lunch was non existant i turned down street and literally stumbled on this corner bistro i was in the hot pursuit for comfort food a toasty sandwich and a hot bowl of soup i must have timed it right before the lunch rush as it was just me i am writing this as the rich aroma from the cream of mushroom soup tickles my nose a new spin on a classic grilled cheese sandwich and my taste buds have found happiness like a warm blanket on a cold saturday morning make sure to check out this quaint bistro where staff are welcoming with bug smiles and the hockey game in the background perked up my canuck winter blues", "i contacted villa bistro to organize a small covid friendly th birthday dinner for our mother i spoke with keltie who is one of the co owners and she was extremely helpful i asked if they could set up a section with socially distanced tables for our guests and she was very accommodating we organized a set menu with keltie and chef rui who is the other co owner the food was absolutely delicious and our server emma was very attentive and helped to make the evening perfect our guests all enjoyed the food service and ambience and are looking forward to returning in the future thanks to keltie rui and emma for making our mothers birthday dinner so special", "i popped into villa bistro because i was waiting for the red arrow bus and it was hot out and there were people on the patio and they had a happy hour and i was thiiiiiirs tay man am i ever glad i did this place is great and i have not even eaten there yet i sat at the bar and chit chatted with owner and drank my happy hour pint and it was an absolute treat i am starring this place based on the d\u00e9cor the location and the lovely people that run it just by watching how much care went into the cocktails that were being made and the care going into polishing glasses while serving and having a sincere conversation with me i can tell this place is a total lucky find on my part i have not even tried the food yet you guys but boy oh boy i watched the dishes coming out of the kitchen and everything looked spectacular there is not a doubt in my mind that everything is not as delicious as it looks i have been away at work for weeks and legit my first stop when i get home is to hit villa bistro they advertise a course date night on saturday nights appy main and dessert plus off cocktails and ill be hitting that up as soon as possible", "hidden gem tucked away south of jasper ave on s st this place deserves more evening traffic than it gets we booked a table for on a cold friday night in january and when we arrived there was only other group of customers in the place menu has the usual bistro things like burgers sandwiches salads and a good selection of dinner type things like pasta short rib and salmon i chose the loaded villa burger and it was absolutely delicious thick handmade patty that was juicy and flavourful fresh toppings and lovely flavourful sauces like aioli and a couple slices of glazed bacon it was possibly one of the best burgers i have had in edmonton i chose the truffle fries as my side and they were also full of flavour and delicious service was also excellent really friendly knew the menu and went above and beyond to make sure our experience was a good one beer menu was ok but only had local beer option edmontons beer scene is getting to be very good it would nice to see more restaurants support them instead of the big brand stuff food service beer", "i went to check out villa bistro a couple weeks back with a couple coworkers it is tucked away on the end of st that i rarely venture but definitely is worth a visit they do have a patio for those nice summer or spring days as well as ample seating i believe this previously was the location of a sandwichsoup joint a few years back as i recall catching up with a friend here once the cafe is modern and quite quiet so it makes for the perfect ambience to catch up with a friend or have lunch or dinner meeting or even a small getogether they do also have different specials throughout the week we happened to stop in on a thursday when they have pasta specials my co workers both ordered the seafood linguine filled with salmon scallops and prawns and came with a slice of garlic bread on the side and looked delicious the portion size was decent i opted for the piece fish and chips because i was in that kind of mood that day it was served with fries and coleslaw that kind of was more saladesque but still delicious nonetheless the leafy greens were fresh and crunchy and the dressing was just right the fish was super flaky and served with some tartar sauce on the side service was quite speedy and attentive despite there only being one waitress that day perfect when you only have an hour long lunch break the next time you need a quiet place to catch up with a friend villa bistro definitely is worth being a contender", "villa bistro is the new restaurant where the free press bistro used to be and i loved it the service was great friendly and fast we grabbed a seat on the patio for lunch on saturday the prices are a little expensive but i found the value to be totally worth the money we ordered the salmon salad and a pulled pork sandwich with fries and shared both the salmon salad i was especially leery of because it was yikes but it looked delicious and we were splitting so i gave it a try and boy am i glad i did they split it for us and it was a large portion absolutely worth with roasted yams and brussel sprouts and a champagne vinagrettei can not wait to eat it again like i said we also split the pulled pork sandwich with fries which was the pulled pork was a little bit spicy with a nice creamy slaw on top it was great although a little expensive i feel like the prices are in line with delicious downtown food overall i loved it and will be going back often", "absolutely delicious this restaurant has been recently renovated and looks so fresh its the perfect place for some delicious bites and great wine to go with it friendly attentive service very clean and tables are socially distanced already they have a great patio for those warmer lunch times i had the lamb popsicles they were so good must be eaten hot so eat these first then i had the calamari and wow these calamari are one of my favourites so far they have a portuguese flair with olives and tomatoes delicious and to finish i tried the fries which were light and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside definitely recommend this place if you are downtown and want some portuguese inspired cuisine", "highly recommend checking out the new location all new menu items are really a step above to top it off the ambiance of the new location was amazing great big airy patio with an awesome view quality covid measures put in place with socially distanced tables and staff wearing their masks properly can not recommend enough", "great locale and delicious items we shared appy salad and mains excellent we will be back", "had a bad feeling about this call ord\u00e9red pick up for at then tried to order the short rib with risotto no short rib tried to order the filet of beef told the only had a filet of fish they could order me a tenderloin of beefwhatever i ordered risotto instead of potato beef came cooked right but with potatoes not risotto and served as if made at for pickup dessert a dixie cup of icecream a slab of brownie with tiny slices of poached pear underwhelming", "i hate that i have to dole out a on a place but this is what it is joint was exceptionally bad from the get go on the ruins of what was nellosil pasticchionellos lays the newest italian reincarnation of the iconic spot on the corner of st and avethis place has a special spot in my heart my grandmother used to love this spot back in the day and we celebrated a few birthday dinners years agounfortunately its fallen on hard times we walk into an empty room basically and after having a laugh at getting propositioned for oral pleasure by a homeless person in the bathroom albeit a public bathroom i was certainly hoping for a good mealmy bad we started with some lamb lollipops with a chimichurri which looked absolutely incredible but fell majorly flat just under seasoned and bland well cooked temperature wise but just blah the chimi was super oily and did not have much flavour at allnot a good start fingers crossed for the mains i ordered the braised short rib which i am going to order pretty much every time i see one on a menuunfortunately they did not have any ready we were told it would be ready in an hour or sothis was at on a friday nightcause why would you have that ready not sure who is running the kitchen but you would better be able to produce items from the menu at on a friday night especially when there is table in your restaurantso i settled for a lobster gnocchi while my gf decided on the half chicken with fried brussel sprouts and mash i have never had more dense gummy gnocchi in my life instead of light and fluffy it was a little like eating chunks of dry wall paste the lobster was ok pretty over cooked but not terrible the gf had thee most over cooked dry chicken one could possibly imagine to the point where she could not even come close to finishing it the mash was just blah and the gravy was congealed and disgusting huge props on the brussel sprouts though they were delicious so a couple pointersafter we finished our lamb lollipops we had used our utensilsthey were placed neatly on our side plates instead of taking them and bringing new ones we were instructed to just keep them and put them on the table while she got us some new napkinsjust pony up the new roll ups ok like seriously there is people in the whole place i think it could be done the napkins are another thing they were literally the cheapest things ever like the ones you pull outta the tin dispenser on your table at a burger baron if you are going to try to put on the facade of fine italian dining even in these extraordinary times pony up for a real napkin please not even cloth just more than one ply please if you are going to serve chicken dry or not and lamb maybe a steak knife of some kind dull bread knives are not going to literally cut it we ducked out before having to endure dessert our server was lovely and was trying her best but clearly was under trained and not very knowledgeable i really wanted to like this place but it needs some serious work or this will be another restaurant on the garbage pile of covid i hope this stuff can be fixed and would actually like to give it a try when they get back in shape cheers andy", "quality food and a cozy atmosphere i had the tacos and berry punch suggested from the friendly waiter and it was so tasty highly recommend", "best steak house in edmonton great fresh salads pizza and steak service for the most part is good and the steaks are always cooked perfectly the cesar salad is the best i have ever had", "we usually go every few weeks and the food and service is excellent all that changed last night when we were kept waiting over an hour for our food the server explained they had a order come in for pizzas and people who had been seated minutes after us were chewing away at their dinner we also had to flag our waitress older petite blondish hair down to order more drinks after a minute wait between beverages it was later on a friday night the dinner rush was over but we still felt completely overlooked the food is excellent however my husband had the ribs his usual last night and he said they tasted phoned in my lasagna was perfection and i am glad i ordered it rather then my usual steak and potato the highlight is always the parkinglot there is a porsche gtrs that always makes me smile and when i am able to park next to it in my cayenne turbo yes i know i am not your typical womani love cars i imagine what it would be like to accidentally swap keys with whomever owns that car we will return the food and normally the service is just too good to stay away besides i might figure out who the owner of the car isand convince himher that a porsche swap is due", "i am always on the lookout for a good pizza place and since we were headed to the eskimosriders game it seemed like the perfect opportunity to check this place out when we arrived it was packed but thankfully we did not have to wait at all the restaurant is quite large and there were a lot of saskatchewan roughrider fans myself included enjoying a meal before the game i ordered a coffee and we got a large meat pizza unfortunately with it being so busy my coffee cup sat empty for awhile the pizza arrive in a reasonable amount of time fresh from the oven piping hot the pizza was very good no complaints i loved the chewy crust with the crispycheese edge there were a decent amount of toppings tasty sauce and lots of cheese perfect our waitress was extremely busy but took the time to compliment my rider jersey and apologized for being so busy she was very sweet and was clearly busting her ass to trying to do a good job while we were waiting for our food i saw a lot of delicious food coming from the kitchen the steak shrimp looked delish we definitely plan on returning to try a few other items on the menu", "great steaks the flavour of their beef is wonderful and not duplicated anywhere else always popular efficient service and the caesar salad sure is not lacking of dressing", "i have not been here for a few years only because when i visit edmonton approximately once a year there are so many great restaurants to choose from when we arrived here tonight there was a line up of people inside to get seated though the restaurant was only half full then the hostess was busy answering the phones taking pick up orders after mins we finally got seated and ordered the waitress was quick to take orders but did not try to upswell or make suggestions we chose the ny steak lobster the house dressing for the starter salad is a must to try as it is delicious i have to say when the entree arrived it was amazing succulent alberta steak decent sized lobster tail steak fries and garlic toast one thing though i noticed that our orders sat on the pass for around mins before the waitress brought it to us this is probably why the fries were luke warm and steak was no longer steaming hot we also witnessed a young waitress that stormed into the restaurant heading into the kitchen complaining about how busy it was we really do not want to hear staff complaining about their job when we are trying to enjoy our expensive dinneralthough the food was great it lacks an expeditor proper hostess and a manager overseeing everything this place has been around for decades and the interior reflects that when you walk in there is a christmas tree seriously with some cheap dining chairs to sit on in the dining area there are barrels stored above everywhere and the bar had some tacky tiki signs great food can not be beat but the service can definitely use improvement and the really bad old tired decor has got to go this is why only stars", "we have been going here since i was a child delicious food and reasonable prices this is a diamond in the rough will always be a fave", "i could not believe that when i moved back to the neighborhood after two decades away the pizza was every bit as good as i remembered i typically order extra cheese at coliseum i do not need to incredibly consistent quality and still a very comfortable place to eat although the decor does not appear to have changed a bit either i am definitely a regular again and a very happy one only shaved a star because i work long hours and tend to be there at the very end of the day and the wait staff have more than once started rushing us out before it was even closing or wed finished eating and were always very careful not to go to a restaurant unless were sure well be finished before they close i have worked retail i understand that said they get the orders right and do tend to take good care of you eg coffee refills checking that everything is alright etc and are always pleasant and polite so on the whole the staff are part of why its such a good place to go please just let me finish eating guys", "so the place tells you on the sign that its years old and all the good parts of that are clear to see i had the coliseum loaf and my wife had the calamari caesar salad lots of it was good the loaf was solid and substantial like you would look for in a baked italian sub with a side of marinara it was not spectacular but it was very good the calamari was adequate well battered and seasoned if slightly over cooked the caesar itself was over dressed and looking a little like it was mixed the day before the service was quick and courteous this was on its way to three stars until i went to the washroom and had to share the stall with cockroaches yes plural i guess years was a good run but its time for this legend to retire", "my husband and i have eaten here many times over the years before oilers games and concerts only i feel the service is very rushed but that is probably why in general i find the food to be a great value the steaks can be a little inconsistent i have started ordering the t bone which i think may be one of their best steaks i love that the meals start with a green salad they are always fresh and the house dressing is delicious the garlic toast is great too if you are looking for a reasonable steak dinner with all the fixings this is a great choice only downside is that it could use an up date very dated and not a lot of ambience", "first time visit to this edmonton staple went pre oil kings game and it was busy but was still able to get a table for without any problem even joined in singing happy birthday to a year old who was there with generations of his family i think my singing caught them off guard or it was off key ordered a super meaty pizza that was pretty well the best meat pizza i have had in a long time the dough was amazing and was maybe the best part of making this experience worth going back again the service was strong even though the server had a large section including that large birthday party we were in and out in time for the game which was impressive because of how busy it was decor was over shadowed by the great atmosphere this is not the prettiest restaurant but the busyness and pre game buzz made it a fun place to be ill be back", "went here for the first time and had a wonderful steak which was cooked really well the garlic bread was good and all the accompaniments to the meal were cooked well i would come here again", "great atmosphere free parking for oilers games and delicious food one guy in our group ordered his steak chicago blue which requires a really hot grill all guys in our group ended up with over cooked steaks too bad but its probably that guys fault for throwing the grill temp off they still get stars because we did not try to send them back and when the waitress asked how the steaks were the only guy to respond said good at least they use really good meat so overdone is still stars", "you do not come here for the atmosphere you come here for the steak and sometimes the pizza steak is cooked perfectly and the servers are efficient it is perfectly situated to attend before events at rexall place and even when its busy you do not have to wait too long for a table do not come here expecting speciality drinks or gourmet food as its fairly low brow that way but again consistently straight forward uncomplicated good food served efficiently", "ordered the steak with baked potato with mushrooms on the steak was fantastic the only complaint i have is the salad was wet fix this and i will give full stars waitress was attentive and friendly went away full", "the food is always good here have yet to be disappointed with the food steaks are always done just right pizza is great soups are tasty however i wish they had bigger bowls they are only about a cup or seem like it anyway beef ribs are ginormous and so good so many good menu items my default is the steak sandwich with baked potatoes steak rare the place is extremely busy on game nights before the game", "on march we visited this place as before a game ducks in town maybe i should have ordered duck because my prime rib burger tasted more like regular burger i asked if i could substitute the fries for caesar salad and she said nope she did not even say for an extra dollar or two whatever i had to have the fries no alterations at least we all thought she was funny like the soup nazi on seinfeld so my heart had fries and i am still living and we wonder why our diets suck and are headed for demise hehe i will come here again before a game but maybe stick with pizza for what their people know how to make", "not bad for a dive bar but i do not think ill be back the food we had was good but the menu is limited if you want to consume anything healthy this is all carbs and fat in monster portions good luck even getting a salad that is not the maximum number of calories possible to dump on lettuce if you are gluten free or vegetarian you can not eat here all that said my souvlaki was delicious and everyone at my table enjoyed their plates as well service was kind of short and curt with us even though we had made a reservation and warned them wed be a big group the restaurant was not busy when we were there so there was no reason to rush us through our orders regardless decent food if you want a steak sandwich fries definitely come here but if you want anything else stay away", "we were excited to try this resteraunt because of some good reviews so we ordered a starter which was delicious but the main course was brought to us half way through the appetizer so we could not enjoy the full starter the main course was put in the table and the server shoved out starter out of the way i then told the server we were not ready for the starter yet to which we received the statement what do you want me to do about it by the waiter the waiter had not checked to see how the food was but occasionally looked over to see if we were done yet and it felt like we were rushed to get out when the bill came the waiter dropped it off and told us to pay at the front then walked away there were three staff personnel on shift at the register who asked us how the meal was and we told them the food was good but the service was lacking their reply was have a nice night i would not recommend you go to this place for the service alone it is unfortunate because it had high potential of being a good resteraunt but it is all lost in the poor service and the menu which was lacking", "i love the ceaser salad and the garlic ribs they are always perfect", "their pizzas are amazing perfectly tangy pizza sauce crispy in just the right way about dollars a pizza but you do not leave feeling unsatisfied", "we went here yesterday before the last oilers home game of the season the place was packed as we expected but there was only one couple in front of us so we were hopeful the hostess told us that we could be sat right away but we would have to sit with another couple that would be coming later i asked how long we would have to wait if we did not want to share table and she bluntly said the game started at i was hesitant but agreed and was not happy about it we got to our table and sat down i really could not believe that they would cram people in to the point of sharing tables with other strangers just for an extra couple of bucks i was really peeved by this no one was at the table but every time a hostess walked by with people i thought oh crap no one ever came to join our table but the fact that we were even asked just in case showed me how money hungry this business was we ordered and our food took forever i guess that is to be expected because the place was packed but it was over minutes for a medium steak sandwich and a half vegetarian loaf our food finally arrived and ryans pathetic little steak potato and garlic bread was sure a rip off for he was so disappointed when he cut into his steak and it was well done i enjoyed my food but it was nothing special really we left feeling neglected as customers and disappointed as food lovers we will go back hoping that it was maybe an off night but the nostalgia of this place has truly changed for me", "easy atmosphere dinner before a concert or even a hockey game and this is your place to be convenient location solid food with decent portions i liked what i ordered and there were no complaints from around the table they take reservations which is good if you know you have limited time and can not wait the server was attentive i will definitely be back again", "coliseum steak pizza is my favourite steak house in edmonton they also make a mean pizza but its the steaks that make it worthwhile while the location and the exterior of the building might make you weary as many of my friends were when they saw that i had made a reservation for my fiancees birthday party do not let that fool you this place has some of the best food in the city and they have got decades of experience in the business apparently one of their cooks has been grilling steaks in their kitchen for years he definitely knows how to cook a perfect steak the prices are good the food is outstanding though i am pretty sure the soup comes from a can and the staff are friendly the old school charm of coliseum makes it so that you feel like family even if it is your first time in the restaurant despite my glowing review id probably give only stars if we could give half ratings on yelp while most of the food is great i am pretty sure that the soup is canned and the pizza while good is certainly not the best in town but these are minor issues and so i am rounding up and giving coliseum steak pizza a full stars", "a few co workers have raved about this restaurant and there were a lot of strongly positive reviews for it online so i was excited to try it after experiencing it for myself the only reason i can guess why certain people like it so much is because none of them ever cook for themselves if that is the case then this restaurant makes sense but if you are the kind of person who likes to eat out so they can try foods they normally would not or could not make at home like me then id say its best to skip this place i had a steak which came with fries or baked potato salad or soup and garlic bread i went with the fries and salad options the reviews that declare that this place makes the best fries ever baffles me since they are the kind of fries you can find anywhere pretty standard nothing special the salad was a tiny plate of mostly iceberg lettuce that could have come from a ready mix bag the steak was ok but quite small i asked for it medium rare and it was cooked that way but the meat was a bit tough i have definitely made better steaks myself at home my friend ordered the chicken greek salad which was a giant plate of iceberg lettuce again very similar to the ready mix kind you buy in large bags at the grocery store with a couple of olives thrown in and some diced chicken fingers on top as for the great service again ill have to agree to disagree the waitress repeatedly reached across me without apologizing or saying excuse me we were never once offered refills or our drinks and only managed to finagle a pitcher of water when she came back to give us our bills she came across as very impatient and seemed annoyed when i asked what the soup options were all in all i felt like the food was the equivalent of what any amateur could accomplish with a quick run to the grocery store for twice the price plus tip if your fridge has only ever contained beer and hot sauce this is a good place to go for a quick and simple if over priced meal if you are looking for something a little more exciting that is worth dishing out your hard earned money for id recommend exploring other options", "this is a really busy place on game nights so do not be surprised when you have to wait in a long line up that being said it is worth the wait the only thing i tried here was the pizza and it was delicious it was crispy but not crunchy and the toppings were fresh i can not really say anything bad about this place other than the long wait but that is just a testament to how good it is", "well we walked in at and they close at we were told we had to order as soon as possible because the kitchen will close right away at first the staff seems annoyed but we hurried and order within seconds they became very accommodating we had the coliseum pizza special and a top sirloin medium rare with fries the food came out fast but looked and tasted good the pizza was stacked high with toppings and lots of cheese the steak was huge and cooked to perfection the only fault was the steak needed to rest but obviously the chef was in a rush so he did not do that so when we cut into the steak it bled out not a biggie for the size of the portions the price was great you could not get a steak that size at the keg for that price biggest downfall was there was only two tables left and we were still eating the waitress decided to turn off all the lights music and televisions only lights were left on were the dining room which made it dark and awkward with no background music yes we get you are closing sorry but the restaurant is open till pm the kitchen closes at i think you should still leave the ambience on i gave stars due to the fact the food was good and the price was great i will return but probably at pm", "this place is a pre game tradition for many hockey fans the steaks are charred on a grill the baked potatoes come wrapped in foil and the fixins come in that trio of stainless steel dishes so order up a big slab of beef get the side order of mushrooms a beer at a third of the price of the rink and pretend the oilers are still a championship team pizza is ok too", "finally tried the legendary coliseum steak pizza word is the great one drops by if hes in edmonton it was a hangout for the s oilers before hockey players went into tax brackets the rest of us can only dream of lots of pictures on the wall went for the special ny steak with mushrooms garlic bread choice of potato and choice of soup or salad salad was bog standard basically lettuce but the blue cheese dressing helped a great deal steak outstanding as good as it gets i am going to garlic bread was tasty too mushrooms were tasty with just the right amount of seasoning it was steak fries which are not my favourite prefer french fries but they were done the way they should be highly recommend this place", "best pizza in edmonton by far their lobster is fresh and delicious their pasta could be a little thinner but still good their fish and chips are about a fillet pretty decent margins its almost cheaper to buy from them and and have them cook them than to cook at home", "we decided to try this place out on a friday night on a whim i had been here a few years ago and had a nice lunch with a friend fast forward yearsit was time to bring e here to show her what an old fashioned steak house is like we went at about pm and the parking lot was full we were worried it would be too busy to get a table but upon entering we were cheerily greeted and seated immediately the place was packed but there were a few empty tables busy restaurants are good and bad busy is good because the food gets turned over quickly thus it is more fresh busy is bad because service usually suffers as a result but not here the waitress came immediately to take our drink orders very impressed she was friendly and on no waiting no delays no looking around wondering if anyone noticed we had been seated we started with the calamari which was actually very good it was buttery tender had a nice dipping sauce and was topped with peppers and green onion it was actually one of the better versions we have had the batter was light and crispy staying with the fast service theme the appetizer came within minutes but quality was not sacrificed due to speed it was perfectly cooked e ordered a shrimp entree that came with an average salad seemed bagged tsk tsk a good ole fashioned baked potato and of course the battered shrimp and dip which she claimed to be excellent d ordered that t bone steak salad bagged baked potato perfect and a fairly good t bone it was perfectly cooked and from past experience these folks know how to cook a steak properly my only complaint is that it was a tad tough in spots but it was not a deal breaker as in general it was very tasty and cooked by someone who knows what they are doing chop maybe hire some of the cooks from this place the steak was seasoned perfectly not over seasoned as to mask the taste of the meat well done chefs our mains came lightning fast and the guy who garnishes the potatoes came shortly after to top them off nice touchi like the old school way of doing potatoes not having to ordered loaded ones as the newer places seem to do both entrees came with garlic toast too the bill came as fast as everything else which was great i really have a problem with the good service wait minutes for the bill epidemic when it comes to most places our waitress was suitably rewarded for her excellent and professional service our meal came to about including two sodas and it was money well spent the steak could have been a bit less grissly sp but when you get service this good one tends to overlook things like that service was extremely fast but you never felt rushed these people have this gig down pat and could school a lot of the more expensive steak houses on service and quality we look forward to going back and trying some of the other types of steaks they offer and even the delicious lobster that a lot of people were ordering thanks for an awesome experience", "awesome combo of food and value for dollar two of us had the oz new york steak special for includes soup or salad baked potato or fries pan fried mushrooms and garlic toast steaks were perfectly done these people are steak professionals old school style the steaks sliced like melted butterour other companion had the ribs he raved as they fell apart dripping with flavor the garnishes for the baked potatoes are s style served as you like it from the silver serving dish as much butter sour cream bacon bits and fresh crispy green onion as you like the service is warm attentive and as if you are a regular even if you are not we have been here before we do not go often and now we wonder why an added tidbit of info edmonton was recently listed as for best pizza in the world this place was listed as one of the pizza places worthy of special mention for edmonton making the list", "i have been here three times in the last four months after having heard rave reviews about their pizza the first time we had a pepperoni and ham pizza which is decent but not great the cheese is plentiful but the pepperoni reminds me of the cheap superstore variety also the crust is a bit too wholesome tasting almost like whole wheat bread the second time we had the ribs and a steak sandwich the steak sandwich was delicious but the ribs were horrible the third time we had a oz new york strip a medium pizza and battered cod with fries the strip was very good the pizza ok and the cod pretty good on the downside the french fries are thick steak fries that do not have the same crispness and flavor as do the thinly cut fries that you see served more often these days bottom line if you are in the area for an oilers game come here for the steak maybe a pizza if you are craving for it but do not make a special trip to this restaurant", "best place for a steak sandwich hands down this place can get pretty busy but if you come on a non oilers night or early you should be fine", "went for lunch with a friend seated promptly then ignored when the server finally came over we asked if we could order and she said no i have people ahead of you to order who does that its lunchtime and people are on a schedule food was mediocre at best do not really see the appeal", "well i come in with my family on stpattys and ask for a irish car bomb and the waitress just said no i am sorry what do you mean no no you do not know what the most popular drink on stpattys day is or no you do not want to make it i will not be back here the bartenderwaitress is just miserable just quit", "old school dining at its finest from decor to menu offerings this is a throwback to the ss that said i quite enjoyed myself here the food is not fancy which is a funny thing to say about a steakhouse but its hearty and wholesome the menu is a nostalgic reminder of the ridiculousness of the past ex the appetizer combo for had a million things on itincluding a rack of ribs whaaa who starts with that not going to lie we were so very tempted tried a steak and it was heavily seasoned with a good amount of fat on it yum came with a starter salad we went with clam chowder for an extra charge a heavily buttered piece of garlic bread tasted like it was buttered toasted and then drenched in margarine basically amazing and a baked potato a server comes to the table with all the condiments butter sour cream bacon chives and loads you up fun also tried their signature pizza and it was also pretty good crispy bottom but a bit soggy towards the middle and loaded with toppings not the best pizza in town but it was decent definitely a place with an older clientele or larger families also lots of eps officers the night we were there quick service hearty portions and reasonable prices i dig it", "i have been here twice first time was for my birthday i had a steak and lobster i wanted my steak cooked med rare it came medium well they cooked me another it came out the same i did not eat it my lobster was so rubbery and tasted like leather i could not chew it they reinburst my meal i left unhappy and hungry second time a friend was taking me out to try their pizza we ordered the house special pizza restaurant was not busy the pizza took minutes to arrive service was terrible server was rudewe had no preset for our pizzawe had to beg for a napkins did not have pizza tongs pizza came out on a hot plate and we are suppose to use our hands and have to beg for napkins crust and ingredients were very good except it was sitting too long and became wet did not take home left overs server never asked if we liked the pizza my friends and i left unwanted upset hungry ruined our day felt very unwelcomedhostess asked us if we enjoyed our meal i said no she asked if i informed the server i said i did and she ignored me waitress was extremely snobby very dirty floors in restauranti will never go back should have learned the first time good luck", "my steak was properly prepared my soup was only acceptable and my spaghetti with meat sauce was pretty bad my server was pleasant but the dining space was a bit dingy i am happy to have tried this place out but i do not think that ill return any time soon four stars five stars i do not understand the bases upon which some users of this site base their reviews", "i have been eyeing this place up for quite awhile now every time i drive past i wondered about it we had a lovely server and we were a bit pinched for time but at pm on a a thursday there was plenty of open seating and the service was incredibly fast we ordered the ribs and shrimp as well as the calamari salad the salad was super neat with a greek salad and calamari with tasty taziki and the portion was great the ribs came out way faster than we anticipated but they were very good and interestingly it came with some cut up bread instead of fries prices were about average for what i would expect and the menu would be a good fit for a family dinner out kind of place", "i used to come here all the time as a kid and teenager before concerts and oilers games it was always packed but i imagine it has died down a lot since the arena moved we decided to come here for dinner while i was visiting home and i am so glad we did the decor is extremely dated and it was pretty empty when we went but the steak was so good we all got t bones with fries and garlic toast the steak was surprisingly extremely good the fries could use some more seasoning but overall i was so pleased i definitely want to go back next time were in edmonton", "this is our favourite steak house in town a very casual place with fabulous steaks always perfectly cooked and all the sides are great their mushrooms are fab only time hubs eats mushrooms i have heard the pizzas are great but we come for the beef another great dish is the beef ribs i call them brontosaurus bones they are amazing and when you get the platter you will wonder how you will ever eat it all they serve the best lobster tail i have ever had its a casual very busy place and the wait staff just flies give it a try you will not be disappointed", "was not impressed with the food at all ordered the escargot was burnt then got the coliseum loaf and was disappointed with the quality bread tasted dry like it was left out for a week there was barely any meat but loads of cheese thrbsause was bland in my opinion the service was great waitress was very understanding with the escargot she was very disappointed with how the escargot looked and gladly took it off the order not sure i would go there or recommend this place again", "amazing wow and wow had steak and lobster kicks the keg in the ass service kind fast on point if you have not been this is a must place to come", "one of my favs and go to places i have been dining here on and off since the s great consistent service the place is spotless and the pizza is amazing my fave is the escargot and steak but all entrees are amazing i have never had a bad meal", "best steak in the city my family and i come here for every birthday or celebration the service is second to none", "our favorite restaurant service is fantastic very friendly and deal with any concerns right away quality of food is star best steak in edmonton", "what i liked steak cooked to perfection diner mushrooms baked potato and garlic toast hardy eat good eat excellent value for the dollar an incredible steak", "i have eaten here a few times and had a number of different menu items regardless of the food ordered the service is always good and the staff pleasant the food however seems to just miss the mark every time the dry ribs appetizer is good the rib special is abgood deal but the ribs are low quality meat and the sauce little more than ketchup being fan of ribs i have had them twice and both times they were disappointing tonight i had a t bone steak the steak was well cooked to the medium side of what i asked med rare the first bite was ok but after that it went down hill as all i could taste was salt not steak spice or even seasoning salt but the steak was salted heavily the sole redeeming grace in my visits here so far is the pizza its a deep dish with a thick crust and not a bad amount of toppings and cheese", "i came here for a business lunch and it was not too busy it did fill up with more customers during my visit but it was never packed nor too noisy we were seated towards the back where it was slightly raised from the rest of the restaurant they pushed tables together to fit us all the server was attentive and friendly to bring us our drinks take our order and check on our food i found the lunch menu a little limiting as i did not want pizza salad or steak but then again i am at a pizza and steak restaurant i decided on the coliseum loaf but asked for light cheese as i think it stated it came with cheeses it was on a toasted sesame bun and cut in pieces there was pizza topping meat inside i can not remember it all but i should have known it would be a bit too salty for my liking i can not even recall if there was any cheese in it the sandwich was ok and i think next time i would stick with ordering pizza as i am not a big steak eater if we had another meeting here i would not mind but would not make a special trip for a meal here", "i was super impressed with this restaurant my boyfriend and i went here before an oil kings game and when i say before i mean a couple hours we had to wait in a very long line up and for good reason the food here is amazing my boyfriend and i shared a ceaser salad and i got a sandwich sub the ceaser salad was amazing and i loved my sandwich i hear that the pizza here is amazing as well this place gets super busy on game nights whether the oilers are playing or the oil kings i assume it is busy on nights when there are concerts or other events at rexall as well be prepares to wait but please do it is so worth the time", "i am surprised i have never heard of this place until recently however location is not ideal for me since i live on the other side of the city this place offers cozy comfort food for a reasonable price the portions are big and food was delicious i ordered the house special steak with mushrooms on top for around it came with steak grilled to your liking pasta salad and garlic toast i was so full afterwards and it was a very satisfying meal this is a great place to go if you are hungry and want a good old fashioned hearty meal", "a great place to go for a decent steak or a hearty pizza very down to earth and friendly", "have not been here for awhile every time i go i am reminded how much i love it consistent menu good service lots of parking old school decor and most importantly great steaks cooked to perfection i enjoy the simple baked potato and how the garnishes come in a little tray doled out by the server the garlic toast is fresh and buttery served hot and crunchy for me coliseum holds its own against any steakhouse in yeg", "honestly i was very surprised i had no idea what i was in for because of the area in town but it was pretty great it had a nice family ambiance and was surprisingly busy i tried the vegetarian loaf which is actually a sandwich that was a bit strange otherwise though it was good our server was awesome i has a long island iced tea which was pretty darn good i would actually come back here my partner had steak and he loved it definitely was pleasantly surprised", "i have never been disappointed in this place food is always great and service is usually excellent its are go to place in edmonton for a good quality steak or pasta cheers", "we have gone to this resturant for many years its great comfort food and good service some of the staff have been there for years pastas are very good and the old school pizzas are fantastic", "i am giving this rating only based on customer service from the chef not the foodwe went last night for supper people waitress was attentive and polite when i place my order for a steak sandwich which was a aaa new york strip i asked the waitress to please have the chef prepare it rare with no seasoning salts or anything salty i asked if he could grill it with just pepper on it she came back moments later apologizing and embarrassed to tell me the chef would not put pepper on my steak what are you kidding me this is the stupidest thing i ever heard i should of called the manager but i did not want to make a scene over pepper we spent that night and i did not get my steak the way i wanted it we will not be back i am sure if an oiler team member asked for this it would have been done they should be embarrassed at this customer service the steak was stringy and not very tender for a aaa", "good food and good service decor is not fancy but they know how to cook steaks and their steaks are always good best steakhouse", "lobster is rubbery and steaks well all depends who is working that day hit or miss", "came here when i was a kid a few times have not been here since i am now had a new york steak and it was cooked perfectly best steak i have not had a steak this good in quite a while service was excellent if i had to pick on something it would be the baked potato it was not hot enough to melt the butter", "peter and his large family run a wonderful greek western restaurant it has been his passion to have the best marinated beef steaks has always been a go to on game night and has pictured displayed to prove it never leave hungry a value at any price his daughters are very prominent in the business now i recommend this establishment highly and makes a nice date night or family out", "this needs a connor mcdavid super star cooksuper star staff and make over at this place i have been here before for work lunches many times and recently set a meeting over the lunch hour we made reservations and arrived on time the parking lot which is usually full with dining patrons was empty literally i looked through the windows and seen their lights were still on so we went in there were only about tables being used among a sea of brown empty chairs and tables all vacant just like the parking lot i began to wonder why on a friday afternoon at pm no one else wanted to eat here there were two lunch specials each for their prices had gone up we ordered the fish special but it only came with soup and salad so payed extra for thick cut fries and gravy other guests ordered the chicken salad and chicken strips with fries total bill over with non alcohol drinks and lunchfor people way over priced no one wanted to finish their food hanging in the front entrance there were some old framed pictures from their past glory days which reminded me of past visits with better food lower prices and a busy thriving lunch hour i can only guess that the closing of the rexall place has caused a once beloved restaurant to strive to just stay open and sometimes the difficulty with trying to live in the past glory days is you only end up living in a shadow of your former self note to cook when you cook chicken strips in the same oil fryer as fish sticks they taste like fishthe other orders with chick strips and chicken salad were just disappointingi am giving two stars mostly out of courtesy for their past history and glory with a personal promise to myself to not live in this past and also to not return", "tried this place for its rave reviews but sadly on this day very disappointed with the baked lasagna and meatballs the portion size was pretty small for the price i am going to and meatballs dried right out maybe it was pizza they were referring to", "this pizza and steak joint has been around since the early s the decor has not changed much so its like stepping back in time service is super friendly and place has an ambiance that is warm and inviting they had a new york steak special tonight with buttered mushrooms which came out nicely seasoned and comparable in execution to high end steakhouses i swapped out the side of friesbaked potato with spaghetti and homemade meat sauce for my toddler who made quick of messy work of it lol thr side of clam chowder was tasty and had a good handful of clams in it we also went with the coliseum special pizza added pineapple for the toddler which was a nice thick crust pizza loaded with toppings its solid tasty fare and combined with the friendly staff its easy to see why this place has been around for years", "we were visiting from out of town when a friend drove us to cps for lunch we all had steak sandwiches which we understand is their known for food was great and was only surpassed by the friendly service will go again when next in edmonton", "i have been enjoying my favorite steak sandwich for many years at coliseum pizza steak the staff are very loyal and have been in the business for over some years my steak is always cooked to perfection large portion of fries and fresh fried mushrooms to compliment the steak are amazing the d\u00e9cor is really really outdated as well as the serving dishes are right out of the s wooden salad bowl oil vinegar condiments and salt pepper shakers are filthy they have not changed the menu in years but that is the reason the food remains constant", "well i picked up a pizza for take out have heard a ton about this place i decided to go with the coliseum special which is shrimp all of pepperoni green peppers mushrooms etc the large size about bucks and it was awesome really crispy thick crust pan pizza a bit pricey but that is what you get for home made is also very thick way more toppings and your typical delivery pizza place definitely a great pizza and i will try to get back here before and we were game to check with the atmosphere that i read some of the reviews i also posted the picture of the menu so you can take a look as there is no website or online menu", "i tried coliseum pizza and steak house for the first time and i want to say how impressed i was with this restaurant my bfs mom mentioned to me that she use to come here for food with her sister and it was one of their favourite restaurants in the city i have driven by this restaurant many times but this is the first time that i went in for food what have i been missing i ordered the steak ofcourse and it was delicious service was also fast and waitress was friendly this place has been own and run by the same owners for a very long time and they take pride in their food and you can definitely feel it definitely recommend and definitely coming back to try out more menu items", "we love to visit here at first you would think the price is reasonable but when you get your food you will think the price is so cheap food amount is massive if you are a big guy with big stomach definitely should come visit my brother in law said lobster tail here is the best he ever tried", "we had a great steak dinner the steak was melt in your mouth the service was very good we will def be back again", "if you want to go old school throw back to steak and pizzathis is your place the decor of this joint has not changed one bit old wood trim those kind of beige leather chairs and even a few team pics of the oilers from the glory days of the s the food is actually really good and reasonably priced compared to most other steakhouses in the city i ordered the beef ribs while the gf had to try a shrimp and mushroom pizza the ribs show up and i knew it was going to be a sightbasically a flintstone sized plate of cow and bone with fries and garlic bread my lady looked frightenedthe ribs were very flavourful and by the time i was done i swore off food for hours her pizza was delish as well pretty typical pie for a place such as this definitely homemade sauce and lots of toppings sometimes on a cold night you just want the comfort of a rustic place that will feed you right this is the best spot in town for that kind of dinner fine dining it is not but sometimes you just need a steak and a beer oh did i mention it was packedusually a good sign especially with no arena next door to bolster sales on a game night this did create some pretty suspect service though tough to get a second drink etc i felt like our server was a bit burnt out just going through the motions hope this place never changes despite what people say about the dated decor and menu sometimes a travel back in time are not so bad stars cheers andy", "the best pizza i have ever had hands down my fav is the versato special accidently got the flame thrower instead omg is it ever spicy just want to thank them for replacing it for me very awesome customer service thanks", "had this pizza several times already love love love it lb pizza make sure to ask for it flipped they will put it in the box crust side up this way the crust stays dry and crispy a little pricey but well worth it for a treat", "this place has a pretty good pizza if you like lots of stuff good crust tons tons of toppings with a reasonable amount of cheese you can also buy by the slice if you are just wanting to grab a lunch i just ask for what is freshest and go from there there is a couple little tables to sit at but its really take out oriented", "love this place pizza is thick and well priced tastes great oilers special is the bomb", "i have been wanting to go here for a while and am so glad i got to drop in today i have not tried their thin crust pizza yet but i had a slice of the loaded deep dish amazing value the lunch special was slice and a pop for it was delicious and it has been a long time since i have had a piece of deep dish pizza that good i love that they sell slices and the staff are great i really enjoyed my lunch and look forward to going here again", "we called ahead to order and drove minutes to versatos when we went got there to pick up our three pizzas i took them off the counter and almost dropped them immediately i was not expecting them to way as much as a year old haha the pizza is nothing like chicagos deep dish pizza its more like a normal pizza with a ton of toppings on it its so good i wish they delivered or had another location on the south side of edmonton well continue to support this mompop restaurant and if you are driving home with the pizza do not forget to flip them upside down so the crust does not get soggy", "the pizza here is made with the best ingredientsit always comes out perfect if you are a meat lover this is the place for you my only request would be for them to offer a meat sauce as well as their original overall stars from our household", "nobody does pizza like versatos fresh made giant portions loaded up and oh so delicious i love the for versatos special pepperoni salami ham onions green peppers mushrooms pineapple shrimp monza together are mouth watering if you are not up for a whole pizza their single slice with a pop is a great deal", "i go here for lunch to grab a slice befor workand all my coworkers are like where did you get that huge piece of pizza its great service and the food quality is outstanding if you love lots of topping on your pizza this is the place to go", "versatos pizza pound pizza little pricey at for a but all around good pizza tasted good but i would not spend the cash again to buy it", "our first edmonton pizza experience was great we ordered a t rex and a caesar salad the crust was not too thin not too thick toppings were generous with a nice thick tomato sauce well be enjoying leftovers for a few days with this bad boy", "if you like your pizza with a lot of toppings this is the place for you yes a pizza will set you back but so does one at boston pizza and on a slice of their t rex all meat pizza there is more topping than on the entire pizza at bp take out and delivery only but check it out if you are on the north side and want a pizza with generous toppings", "the best pizza in edmonton hands down there t rex pizza is nd to none", "i have been on a hunt for the best pie in the city since i moved to devon years ago i last night my quest has been completed and the hunt is over i found this gem of a pizza place versatos and it was amazing i will be making the min drive from devon every time i want pizza check it out you will not be sorry", "we ordered the inch trex pizza and it was delicious the crust is not greasy and there is a thick layer of different meats if you are hungry this pizza will fill you up it was our first time ordering from them and we would order again it does take hr for the delivery", "sooooo good have to get the big one in the t rex i do not know how many i have ordered but its so good", "there pizza was far better than i expected meat lovers was layered and the best meat lovers pizza i have ever had crispy crust and was just enough to hold the whole pizza together would recommend to anyone who holds there pizza at high regard", "this place came highly recommended for their pizza we tried the big one and boy did it live up to its name if the pizza is going to be in the box for a bit they recommend requesting to have the pizza flipped so that the grease does not soak the box it comes literally upside down not to worry though this pizza is stacked and is jammed so tightly in the box that it barely moved the pizza was pretty darn tasty for a pie with the meat stack an inch high it took a couple days for my girlfriend and i to get through the beast if you like your toppings a mile high this is the pizza for you", "i do not even need to pepper this review with compliments because its just so amazing just try it like you will not be disappointed we live northside and saw this driving by and it became our nye dinner we ordered the versatos special fully loaded took hour to be delivered but that was expected on nye the pizza was hot and delicious and about inches deep will be our new place", "these guys know what big delicious layered with meat and cheese pizza with awesome tomato sauce is i loved every single piece of it and i can not wait to order from them again the leftovers are a hit as well the most important part is it does not taste greasy the crust is not too thick or too thin their customer service is good as well great family business i am happy i can support it", "this place is a pizza factory with a glance in the back you can see they are making pizza after pizza with the thickest toppings you will find anywhere it is pub style pizza that is heavy on the meat has a great complimentary sauce and soft crust if you are looking for that in a pizza this place is for you if you are looking for a something along the lines of a pizza margherita then you will need to look elsewhere", "i have not reviewed versatos yet completely my fault i order pizza from here and i am in a happy food coma for a few days ok so there is levels of pizza offered here they have the typical and competitive for pizza great pizza fantastic crust etc blah blah blah that is not the focus then they also offer expert level pizza i am talking about stacked pizza loaded does not do it justice absolutely not chicago style pizza they do not like being called that and for good reason i mean take a pizza a great pizza then literally double the toppings then add a few more just because you can if you are curious they sell pizza by the slice as well if you are hungry order slice if you have not eaten in a week order slices i am actually not kidding stacked pizza is the only way i can describe versatos as their specialty they make thick pizza lol that is what they can it lol sorry guys i just remembered my favorites are the t rex meat lovers and the oilers deluxe style plus thick pizza amazing quality fabulously fresh and cooked to perfection if you are ordering a thick pizza i offer the following advice plates many plates if you are sharing every slice is heavy with toppings it will not hold its shape if you try to eat it like a traditional pizza slice just do not try it lol napkins read number knife and fork to be used with number know your limit do not grab more than slice at a time it looks like pizza but its actually human pizza kryptonite you will fail period but you will be happy and full recommend them your friends and family will love this place small business local owners taking pizza to a whole new level", "the best pizza in the city also have great ribs and chicken combos and very reasonably priced", "unique pizza the shear amount of deli meat used can not be match by any pizzeria in edmonton", "absolutely amazing service these guys go above and beyond to please customers great prices and fast delivery thank you guys m", "the service was friendly and courteous and we were well attended to when we ordered for pick up the pizza was cooked hot just as we ordered but nothing to write home about the garlic toast was quiet soft and seasoned with marjoram i believe the lasagna was quite bland sauce and cheese was only on the top and the bottom layers was just pasta i have never had lasagna that way and it was quite dry and boring had there been more sauce it would have been satisfactory for what you get the price was a little steep for a small order of lasagna and a medium pizza i might go there again in a hurry but overall not very memorable experience", "ordered delivery first of all it took for ever ordered wings and a donair pizza the wings arrived with no sauce and over cooked and pizza did not taste like anything it tasted very bland the sauce used was very watery will not order again", "will never order from here again over priced for a poor pie donairs are not fresh either other locations are far better", "i will second mike ws review here sams essentially serves royal pizza with a moderately thick pillowy crust and cut into squares but without a royal pain of a wait delivery was friendly and fast ill order from here again when i am craving this style", "i love their perogie pizza but they just changed their starbucks coffee to watered coffee will not be ordering coffee here anymore its gross taking stars just for that", "been coming here for years love the atmosphere love the food and especially love that the servers do not try to up sell the only thing i am not fussy about is that the size and even serving plates for the lasagna is not the same between locations but the bottomless pop is just the thing for the thirsty diner", "for service our first real food place during my trip to edmonton was boston pizza on a tuesday night aka pasta night one thing ill never get used to i do not go to many boston pizzas is how huge their portions aremy friend split a pizza for two and they did not even finish half of it i ordered a boston lasagna which tasted okay however there were some pieces of lasagna that were not fully cooked my other friend we had a table of had a linguini with meatballs and also enjoyed it service was excellent our lady took care of us the whole way and came back times asking us how the food was albertans are so nice", "this is our local watering hole we live close and absolutely love coming to this location we always hit up the lounge and the staff are always great we even get recognized maybe we go too often haha and asked how we are whether or not they actually remember us its a really nice gesture food is always hot and fresh no complaints the best sports lounge bps has tvs everywhere you can look and cold drinks", "i am not a huge chain restaurant fan but my friends chose this to meet actually the patio is quite nice considering that it faces a patio menu items are the basic pizzapastasandwichesappies they have cheap lunch specials too however i went with the salmon power bowl it was filling and delicious however for buck a little pricey service was poor", "i had come in here with a co worker for a few drinks and had really enjoyed myself the service was very efficient and the server we had was really nice to talk too after that experience i had been looking forward to returning and brought my hunny with me for the second trip for dinner again the service was pretty consistent and friendly and it was also nice to see familiar faces as i notice high staff turn over at some of these big chains the food however was a totally different story i had gotten the nachos and they were terrible there was very little to no cheese on three quarters of them and the tomato was also almost non existent the worst part of all of it was the chips were really stale and the unpleasant after taste could not be toned down no matter how much salsa or sour cream i applied even with my boyfriend picking at them there was still half of the chips left on the plate after i finally threw in the towel and i think the server must have known they did not look right when he had initially grabbed them from the kitchen as he cleared my plate and quickly took off without waiting to hear how everything was i might come in for another beer if invited out again but i probably would not go out of my way to return here", "our server was very friendly and patient as she was serving a table of twelve as we were celebrating a year olds birthday the staff gathered around to sing happy birthday the appies and food came hot and the server refilled drinks extra side plates were always provided and the server was quick at providing us the bill and a way to complete payment i was quite pleased with the efficient service and was definitely happy with my beet and pineapple salad", "as a childless woman i was not sure how i was going to enjoy my experience here but i give the good folks at chuck e cheese creditthey do run a fairly tight ship there are lots of staff running around both on the floors and behind the counters so whether you need to order another sample platter or get a refund after a machine ate your token you will never be stuck waiting too long there is also staff at the door and they do stamp the kids to make sure they do not wander away on their own or with somebody they do not know i like that all the games here are just one token there are also quite a few different types of games available from arcade style to games of chance one thing i did notice is that the game area is larger then the play area which means your kiddos are more likely to want to spend their time here and your likely going to be reaching for your wallet on more then one occasion there was a decent amount of food sent to our birthday party table and even with six kids and five adults there was still pizza left over i did find the birthday area to be a little crowded and we did on more then one instance accidentally back our chairs into people from the neighboring party table the staff here were great and very attentive making sure all the special birthday rock stars were well looked after i do not know how many times i would really need to come into a place like this as i do not have that many friends with kids but it was great to see them enjoying themselves as well as reliving some fond memories from my own trips to chuck e cheese as a little girl", "we went today and the kids had an absolute blast there was so many different things to do the pizza and boneless wings were quite yummy to my surprise free refills on the pop i am not sure if healthier drink options were available but i did not see any it was pretty busy and our food was at the table before we knew it i love love love that each gamephotoride is only token i hope that never changes the prizes are over priced for what you get but cmon most places like these usually are it is still a blast my only complaint is the kidcheck program i loved the idea of this they stamp your hand with a number that can only be seen under blacklight your children share the same number so that nobody can leave with a child that is not theirs however when my hubby left a few minutes before me with our son the woman at the front checked his number but did not check our sons when i left with my daughter she did not even attempt to check our numbers until i asked her if she was going to make sure this was my child and when my friend left she tried checking her even though she did not have a kid leaving with her lol this program is no excuse to stop watching your children which is why i did not let it effect my rating too much you will notice alot of wondering children with no parents in sight but again this is on the parents and not the company all in all it was a great saturday afternoon", "wanted to take my year old nephew somewhere to kill some time before supper so decided to go here went on a tuesday evening so it was not so busy i am assuming on weekends this place may be a mad house i like how they will stamp you and your children so when you leave they also scan to make sure its the same number always good to see some good security when there are little kids in a place for you get tokens and all the games take token the only annoying thing is that the token machine only takes or only no complaints on the games there are different varieties that should satisfy the kiddies most dispense tickets which you can collect to trade in for gifts in the end which really are nothing to brag about probably can find same type of toys at the dollar store there was enough to keep my nephew happy and busy for just over an hour on just tokens we never tried any of the food so can not say how it is now i did try some pizza here over years ago when i came with my little cousins and it was very bland then but let us face it you do not come to places like this for the food its just basically to fill up the stomach of little kids so they can play this is not a bad place to bring small kids to kill some time once in a while but i would make sure it was when it was not that busy that way more chance to get on games without waiting and to avoid a room of screaming kids", "the staff here are friendly and the place is pretty clean of course it is nearly impossible for or staffers to keep up with a swarm of children who can destroy a store the size of a small country in under minutes but the staff here do a pretty good job the pizza and food is a bit on the pricey side but nowhere near as expensive as the bowling alley where my daughter had her last birthday party when you enter chuck e cheese they stamp you and your childrens forearms with invisible ink numbers to ensure a match when you leave pretty smart cookies to not wash away the numbers the highlight of the visit is always when chuck e comes out and gives hugs hi s before doing a parade and dance ending in free tickets being thrown into the air for the chitlins to collect tonight we survived an entire hour visit with my and year old though i do feel like i have been hit by a truck from sensory overload screaming children greasy pizza fried food and standing on my feet chasing the rug rats ahem i mean spending quality time with my beloved offspring the pizza was okay def had better and worse kiddos scarfed it down sampled platter for seemed a bit small the chicken and cheesy bread was good but they skimped out on celery and the fries were limp and lifeless inevitably there will always be broken games jammed machines but staff are always available to quickly refund your token and fix it whenever possible secret service style talking to each other i am their little microphones the live action video recording blue screen area by the back stage is always a hit with my kiddos my daughter likes to dance like crazy on the blue screen and its free they also have a climbing structure but trouble is you have to be pretty adept at climbing to make it up to the crawling tubes so my newly two year old has not gotten to experience that aspect yet there are several rides where one token is good for two kids there are games here challenging for any adult to master and easy enough for a two year old to have fun i do think they hit the nail on the head by making every game and ride exactly token tokens are for a or with coupons you can score for we have frequented this location dozens of times over the past years and keep coming back are there things i would improve of course there are but you do get pretty good bang for your buck here and the kiddos really do have fun i think i have gotten to know you well enough that we should be on a first name basis now chuck until later chuck kristin", "my favourite time to visit chuck e is whenever its as empty as possible just because i am not a fan of chaos but i have even survived a birthday party there without too much hearing damage it is possible to find it nearly unpopulated on weekday mornings if that is what you would prefer and i do not mind dropping in with my granddaughter for a short while on a frequent basis she has her favourite games but is also thrilled to perform in front of a camera which projects her dancing up on the video screen for free as another reviewer mentioned all the games only require one token including a photo drawing booth which can accommodate two people at a time this is a bargain that allows kids to goof off or be serious and have something to take home with them we have never cashed in any of our coupons so far because it takes about two million to get a ten cent prize but they are not really the goal when we go there mostly she loves to simply run around play the mario racing game a couple times pose for the cameras and get to meet chuck e himself most days we have tried some of the food and its better than you would expect and we have had many pleasant interactions with staff who remain remarkably patient with replacing stuck tokens finding the elusive air hockey puck and mopping up messes if your children are older there are challenging and competitive two person games but it could be a bit more costly to keep them and daddies entertained there is something about trying to beat high scores that is much more addicting than a ride in a cup of hot chocolate for the toddlers", "tuesday was a slow night so it was nice in that regard but the food was slow coming minutes for fries pizza when it came was thin and not great although manager did offer to redo the pizza with same crust cake we ordered again was half an hour kids were getting restless been here before and service was much better", "i am learning a lot about this place hint if you want to avoid massive crowds come mid afternoon even mid summer it seems quite quiet in here today the kids tend to love this place because it is designed to stimulate all of their senses they will almost always have a great time here the down side the parents always end up paying and its designed to make you pry open your wallet so you do not disappoint the younglings it is possible to find a happy medium though here is my advice feed the kids first before you come there is no food here that is even remotely edible bring multiple children so you can maximize your token purchase go online to chuckecheescom and take advantage of some of the coupons they take a bit of the sting out when it comes time to pay find a table as far away from the action as possible i can take one kid screaming but multiply that by ten or a hundred and your head is going to want to pop seeing the joy this place brings to my sons face is worth the agony i put myself through they truly know how to captivate childrens minds and for that i give them stars i would give them more but there is a large rat that comes out every hour or so and while some kids love him i saw the look of horror on a little girls face i think i shared the same look alberta is supposed to be rat free after all turns out that was actually chucke who knew", "whenever we are in the mood for pizza i usually order busters instead of pizza or pizza hut i absolutely love the garlic cheese bread and the pizza is usually great however at this location it was awful i ordered the fab i had two small pizzas hawaiian pepperonisausage garlic cheese sticks and cans of pop it took over an hour a half to deliver the pizza was doughy the cheese was hard and it was freezing cold i literally had to use the microwave will no longer be ordering from this location", "i have never been to this place but my friend picked up pizzas from here and one was a donair pizza delicious i have never had a donair pizza before and it did not disappoint they load on the meat and the sweet sauce i had no complaints with it at all in fact i found out there is one located near my house and i am going to be going there more often it is priced regularly mediums for bucks so no surprises there next time i order from busters i will try something different so i can find out if there is anything else to this place other than the donair pizza", "busters pizza is not a good deal it all i walked into the store seeing that they sold pizza by the slice but once i got close enough i realized i was not going to eat any of it the slices were turning around in one of those spinning racks and glistening under heat lamps i could see beads of sweat on the cheese seriously this pizza looks as bad as the stuff you see at stadium food stands it should be served with soft pretzels and nachos n cheese when i asked the saleswoman there how much a slice was she sounded as though it was a great deal its pretty much the same as what you would pay at the funky pizza and double what you would pay for a slice at chicago deep dish and yet it looks like something you cooked in your own microwave no way buster", "yikes busters what is up with the prices take a look at their menu a small pizza is wow lucky for me this was a work lunch so i did not have to pay if i did there is no way i would order from here one item you should avoid like the plague is the caesar salad i know i know its a pizza joint so clearly you should not even consider ordering salad i did not order it but of my co workers gambled and ended up not even eating one bite the caesar salad was wilted and looked like it was taken out from the freezer they did not even use romaine lettuce instead they used iceberg how cheap can you be on top of that the chicken that it came with some had chicken caesar salad extra for chicken was dark meat and in tiny unappetizing looking chunks looked like the meat had been cooked two weeks ago shudder as for my order a co worker and i had a small grecos pizza with spinach feta mozzarella and red onions had about small slices taste was decent but a bit on the greasy side we shared an appetizer of garlic bread sticks this was probably the best thing that we ate comes with two sauces marinara and a donair sweet sauce lastly co workers had the baked lasagna which they said was ok but was doused in grease seriously it was so greasy that the top of the lid was soaked shudder anyways i do not know if it varies by location as i had busters pizza from the sherwood park location that was better but avoid the west end one if you must go stick with what they should do best the pizza avoid everything else", "okay i admit i was lured by cheezy marketing such as flashing lights in the windows and completely bright yellow walls that and the fact id never seen or heard of this place before and it looked new and fun i was hoping possibly to purchase a single slice of pizza when i walked in i saw the warmer where there should have been pizzas available but barely looked used i was not too hungry so i just ordered chicken fingers it took awhile but they just put them in when i ordered them which was good because they were super hot i got them to go and ate them in my car they were tasty not greasy and as mentioned hot not too bad but i would not go out of my way for them they also serve donairs", "i was too lured by their cheesy ads they have this walk in special for i decided to buy it i also want to buy their lasagna for they told me that i can not buy anything else with my walk in pizza special i tried to explained that is ridiculous why are not you up sale they say that i can not buy the lasagna with the walk in special and i have to purchase their for special to get the lasagna which is more money ok now i get it the walk in special is to lure people in i was hungry so i got steamed and stormed out and did not buy anything i now vow not to go back again stick to my usual pizza panago", "rip off they fucked up my order and their prices are too high ufo a pizza is better", "i rated this place a star in the beginning there have been several instances with communication break downs and food arriving cold last time which has led me to revise this review once more to negative the the fries were put into a sealed spaghetti container with the tin foil lids so when they arrived they were so soggy and limp as well as a new driver was sent out without change and forgot the pop when i called to mention this i was told that is just how the fries are they are mins from my place there have been plenty of times the fries showed up in styrofoam containers and were so hot i could not eat right away they did not care that someone who spends close to a month on their food was just expressing the change in container and information for them its a shame too because this place does have good food for anyone in the area i would not recommend this place also they close very early i recently discovered laziza which has amazing customer service huge menu insanely huge portion sizes for the cheap prices and is only mins from me in castledowns i strongly urge everybody to check them out next time you have a cravings for delivery you will not be disappointed", "place was empty at on friday staff were friendly and helpful had a small mushroom shrimp and pepperoni pizza and asked for a thin crust they have gluten free crust too but no gluten free pasta pizza with good flavour lots of topping and probably more cheese than it really needs tasted good both hot and day later cold the only complaint is the price really for a small three topping pizza is pretty out there doubt i would go back very often as there are other places just as good at literally half the price i can get an xl at tonys with one more topping which is literally times as much food for they do deliver but small area and there is a substantial up charge", "i love verns pizza in saskatchewan since i have moved to edmonton i just have not been able to find a real good pizza i hate the thin crust trend this is the best pizza i have found in edmonton and surrounding brand new building clean and welcoming", "they were open late which was nice and e got our delicious hot pizza in less than minutes decently priced and pretty good pizza staff was very friendly and the atmosphere open and welcoming we will be back for sure", "we always order pizza from this location for pick up the pizza is ready as promised hot and delicious they even know us by name when we give our telephone number", "this place has only been open since wednesday and they are already doing a banging business in pickup and delivery orders its not hard to see why i have always loved pies from royal but do not think to go here unless i am close well we are definitely close now it take us five minutes to walk unless finn walks himself then it takes a bit longer we went over on friday night for dinner expecting a harried wait based on what we had seen at lunch but it was not bad at all we got right in the decor is minimal with bright paint high ceilings and a nice open view into the kitchen unfortunately they did not have any high chairs i have my fingers crossed that they are going to get some because an extra squiggly little does not do well in a booster seat for extended periods they did have crayons and a colouring page with the kids menu on the back and finn loved that he did unfortunately get a bit of crayon on the new tables but it was bound to happen eventually shawn did his best to clean it up before we left our server was tentative but attentive she made sure to clarify anything she was not sure of before putting our order through our water was always filled and that is something i always look for especially when its wicked hot outside we ordered three things the donair pizza a classic pepperoni with added bacon and the kids grilled cheese with fries finn loved the fries but was not keen on the grilled cheese this confused me until i tasted it they make their grilled cheese with garlic toast so parents of picky eaters beware i however loved it and accidentally are the whole thing shawn was excepting the donair pizza to come with a traditional sweet sauce instead of tomato but it was good none the less the tzaziki had a really strong cucumber flavour i enjoyed it more than most the pepperoni and bacon was heaven one of the things i love most about royal ours is the crust it never disappoints crispy on the outside soft and chewy on the inside thick enough to support the ample serving of cheese its absolute crust heaven the sauce is also stellar its not full of unnecessary spices or other flavours just simple tomato tang it let us the rest of the pizza speak for itself this is one of the best places to get a thick crust pizza and i love that i can just walk over and satisfy a craving whenever i need to eve for lunch did i mention they open at eleven every day yeah its awesome they are also open until midnight on friday and saturday i thought about taking a star off for the lack of high chairs but they might still be getting them and the lovely lady who sat us apologized profusely for it now we do not have to go to the boston pizza across the street yay options", "we ordered pizza for delivery recently and i was quite happy with the quality of the food the pizza was a classic dough and the flavor and texture were great it even stayed crunchy between the restaurant to the house the medium was a decent size and we were both full after slices each there was left for the perfect lunch the toppings were interesting in that it included broccoli on the vegetarian pizza i have never seen that before and it was a pleasant surprise we also ordered a dozen salt and pepper wings which were quite standard in all ways the surprising thing was that the total bill was before tip i checked and the pizza was so the wings and tax were the remaining i guess inflation has really hit hard but i expected a larger pizza or maybe a meat pizza to cost that much i ordered dominos a few weeks back and got mediums and a pound of wings and that came to and fed a lot more servings anyways the next time you want good pizza and got a big work bonus order from royal", "i used to really like the pizza here last couple times we have had it the crust had been slightly burnt underneath last night it happened again and all away around the pizza the cheese was a over crisped brown i do not mind a little bit of crispy cheese but this definitely was not enjoyable and not worth the money i am going to be looking fo a new pizza place", "the food is delicious though a bit overpriced be prepared to wait over an hour for delivery", "i have only ordered delivery from these guys but they are quick and the pizza is alway hot and so good the girls answering the phone have always been nice too we are new to this area and have already ordered about times", "slipping i ordered pick up tonight and was quoted minutes i arrived in and waited minute which was understandable i suppose as it was around pm on a wednesday the female cook was in charge of two young trainees so she had her hands full however that does not excuse all the improper handling of food instances i observed while waiting including touching her ear and mouth as well as one of the trainers picking up spaghetti from a warmer with his bare hands and placing it directly on a plate in the end i had half my order remade but i am not sure ill be back all things considered too bad", "came here late one night the place was quiet and service was quick pizza was delicious as usual and staff were very friendly we also had a garlic loaf which was somewhat lacking in garlic flavour id definitely come here again to have a pizza", "i have pretty much had all the top pizza in edmonton and in my opinion for delivery style you could not beat ufo until royal pizza opened right close to it in my area now i just can not order ufo after tasting royal the crust is the perfect mix between that crisp bottom and soft airy middle try it if you have not you will not be disappointed the guy that works there is always happy and great to deal with so glad i have great options blocks away but royal has my business for the foreseeable future", "back for a second time just as good if you are not a fan of thin crust artisan pizzas this is where you need to comelove this pizza", "royal pizza is still the best pizzeria in town great crusts tomato sauce that is rich and plentiful topping that are fresh fresh fresh service is always prompt and cheerful i am a pizza snob truth be told the pies are big when they say large you need to clear the table i go every month or so you should too if you are you are a pizza lover maybe someday they will also serve thin crust hinthint", "edmontons comfort food being an edmonton kid born and raised here this is absolutely canadian wonderful chef the one with glasses at this location the best pizza from here yet the right amount of everything the cheese on the crust is far the best and the only place for this distinct savoury taste that keeps you wanting more wonderful local business edmontons own great food", "this place reminds of a mom and pop restaurant you would find in a small town the menu is pretty huge but basic at the same time mostly pizza and burgers prices are definitely steeper then if you were to order from say pizza but you definitely get what you pay for the crust is crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside there is mounds of gooey quality cheese i ordered the onion mushroom and tomato pizza it was delicious the one bad comment i have to make is all that cheese made the centre of the pizza a bit soggy so it lost its shape staff were friendly and did the usual quality checks decor is dated but place is clean overall id say its worth the added price", "ordered pizzas for dine in service was decent pizzas arrived at the table and looked like some year old kid made them poor quality for high quality prices the reason we chose this place was to have a good quality pizza tonight was not that case i guess this is another disappointing restaurant we can cross off our list i did not think i had to order extra cheese to get the whole pizza coveredlol", "i remember when royal pizza was good they went the way of the new age just cheap and stingy i hate generic pizza joints but i am going to recommend anyone like the hut or over this place save your money i do not write reviews but they earned this one never again", "gluten free pastai had to try plus price wine mon thurs did not disappoint the selection was just right we found street parking as the lot was full and at pm waited a bit for a table as they do not accept reservations for parties of less than to start we ordered the escargot and it came from the kitchen screaming hot so hot the cheese had broken i was looking forward to the crunchy brown bits to munch on but only had a couple of small bits that survived as a celiac i could not dunk for the garlic butter and they did not bring any bits for my dining companion to dunk after i had finished our server was more than helpful we could have asked but wondered if this was how it was usually served next i ordered the daily special squid mussels and shrimp with a garlic butter sauce and gluten free penne corn pasta i am not usually a fan of a single ingredient gluten free pasta corn tends to be a bit dry and fussy tonight was not much of an exception tasty oh my yes but again without gluten free bread or bun to soak up that beautiful garlic butter sauce a bit sad the seafood was cooked to perfection and i do not get to say that very often the penne well stab it with a fork and some broke in half a large spoon would have been a great addition to the dish for scooping i think i managed ok because i ate almost all of it and forgot to take pictures my dining companions all finished their meals and had desserts which looked fantastic tiramisu was beautiful and large some would share it but for others its just right be prepared to leave by pm on a thursday as the cleaners apparently come soon after i have never heard that before butok not every establishment can handle gluten free ingredients or diners but they did well they were not certain if the gelato was safe and probably cross contamination from others might be an issue so good call by our waitress i am looking forward to the single serving packages of buns from certain gluten free bakers wink wink that might make it easier for restaurants to thaw only one at a time yes you have to keep them frozen until serving they get dried out inedible and gross pre thawed i believe we will return to try more items on their menu", "absolutely love tasty tomato been going here for several years and am never disappointed by it friendly service and warm inviting atmosphere place looks plain from the outside but it has a very clean sharp look to it on the inside went here for an early monday dinner around pm and only a few tables were occupied mondays and tuesdays are off price of wine bottles great deal if you want to drink we received some really great bread with oilvinaigrette for the start of our meal could have ate another basket for sure nice and fluffy with a bit of herbs on top my friend was not in the mood for wine so we just ordered entrees i had one of the specials for the night lobster ravioli with a rose sauce and my friend had the coloured rotini pasta with spinach and switched the sauce to a rose sauce mine was delicious definitely home style comfort italian food at its best would definitely recommend if you are in the mood for italian reasonable prices and perfectintimate place for a date", "i think we have finally found our go to spot for traditional italian cooking there are of course other amazing italian restaurants like corso or cibo but sometimes you just want some pasta and sauce nothing fancy but downright delicious after an extensive online search and several failed attempts to find what we were looking for i remembered tasty tomato a restaurant that does not look like much from the outside but smells delicious from the parking lot the numerous write ups they have on the wall from various magazines and newspapers gave me added confidence when i read them as i waited for my food we felt like take out so i called ahead and ordered a veal parmigiana and pasta entree to share with my husband it came with some focaccia on the side as well the portion was generous perhaps too much for one person but not quite enough for two that is okay though now that we have tried tasty tomato we will definitely be back for more in terms of value the veal parm with pasta was slightly on the expensive side but tasty nonetheless service was friendly and the food was ready in about half an hour", "great family run pasta place the best baked gnocchi i have had anywhere delicious", "this is my favorite place to eat delicious pasta in edmonton it is all homemade fresh food the service is wonderful and the atmosphere is cosy without being too crowded also the calamari is also the best i have had everywhere else its breaded andor deepfried here it is not served instead with a delicious tomato sauce i recommend this place to anybody who wishes a truly tasty treat", "i am not a huge fan of dining out for italian food although pasta is one of my favourite foods i like the simple hearty stuff i cook at home and find that a lot of upscale restaurants overcomplicate things it still tastes good but does not have that homey feel that i have grown to associate italian food with tasty tomato brings that homey feel with a twist delicious i started with the tri colore salad on special it was a bed of mixed greens with grape tomatoes and bocconcini cheese on top with vinaigrette dressing everything tasted great and fresh but i wish there was more cheese there was only little pieces included for my entree i had the lobster medallions with rose sauce on special the pasta was well cooked and lobster was not overdone but the rose sauce was the standout it was tangy creamy with the perfect amount of spice to give it a little kick it was decently sized for a full meal or can be shared with an appetizer for a light meal the service was fast and friendly and our water glasses never sat empty there was complimentary bread and oilvinegar too we arrived at on a saturday night without a reservation and sat down right away but the restaurant was full by and there was a line of parties waiting as we left ill definitely be back but will be sure to make a reservation", "this place is a rare gem amazing meal greal service clean friendly i had the best meal i have ever had in edmonton", "one of the best italian restaurants in edmonton fabulous food and great prices wine half price mon thur steam table lunch on thursday and friday is fast and always great have been a regular customer for over fifteen years angelo and joe will take great care of you", "there is no place in town that even comes close to the pasticcio which is served at lunch it is the ultimate in comfort food the ultimate in ooey gooey tomatoey creamy cheesy goodness", "great food great service cozy atmosphere went there for dinner and was extremely satisfied", "i really wanted to like this restaurant living with in walking distance and a lover of italian food we started with mixed green salad tasted like the bag i am sure it came in the dressing i am sure was literally kraft italian pasta was ok over cooked the only upside was great service atmosphere is terrible might try it again for take out", "beautiful dish wonderfully prepared with an incredible tomato base we chose thr calamari to start it is so refreshing to have a great calamari that is not deep fried for my mai course i chose the special the seafood linguini we along had the gnocchi with cream tomato sauce and the pasta with bolognese while the seafood was slightly overcooked the gnocchi was amazing with perfect pasta pillows in an incredibly creamy sauce the bolognese was wonderfully robust and beautifully seasoned we completed our meal with the bacio bianco a white chocolate vanilla ice cream and raspberry compote creation my daughter loved we will be back", "went to this place after looking it up and it was great primavera was amazing with the spices us and i added a couple of meatballs to kick it up a notch the staff were very nice and seem to be long term and were very quick and efficient awesome i would highly recommend it and will be back soon", "since my favourite pasta place in edmonton closed i have been looking for a new go to pasta place that serves fresh pasta i tried the gnocchi and the rotini dishes and was slightly disappointed the rotini was essentially pasta that i could have bought at the grocery store the gnocchi was homemade and very fluffy but the sauce just did not wow me the cheese also just came in a pile shredded on top the restaurant did not open till so we called and made a reservation on their answering machine when we came in we were told that they do not take reservations over the phone even though on their website it says they take reservations for parties of the waitress was friendly and patient with our larger group and we got good service", "this is hands down the best italian food in edmonton can not get over how great their menu options are the only thing i have gotten from here that i did not enjoy was their lasagne to be honest but seeing as i have been a regular here for about a year i would say the lasagne is a mulligan i would recommend you request angela to be your server as she is just the sweetest and kindest girl service great work tasty tomatoe", "i am so glad to know that tasty tomato sells their tomato sauce because it is amazing the pasta is fresh delicious and a perfect vehicle for the best tomato sauce i have ever eaten yes i realize that generalizations are not a good idea but the tomato sauce deserves it i will definitely be coming back to this gem", "we pass by this place almost everyday we started noticing it at night with the lights beaming inside it looked like it could hold a lot of potential so i checked it out on here and we decided to give it a shot the outside looks like a dive almost but when you get inside it gives off such a romantic feel the service waswonderful most places give super generic service but our servers were so wonderful such awesome smiles from everyone you can tell its a well run place i ordered the con pollo alfredo and subbed linguini noodles the sauce was something amazing my significant other had tiger prawn alfredo and i am pretty sure he finished it in less than minutes he was scarfing it down we will definitely be back", "i love this place i am a repeat customer for years and have never been disappointed the food service and atmosphere are all wonderful", "while i have only been here once my experience was a pleasure not only was the food prompt and delicious but i adored the bread with oil and vinegar and the servers checked with our table regularly to ensure that we were not in need of anything this restaurant is tiny but the food is delicious which totally makes the ambient noise level all right i liked the table cloth the lighting the extensive menu with many options and the aesthetics of this tiny place the parking lot is also small but that is fine too there is easy transit to this location via a number of bus routes as well which is neat", "been on the road for weeks and wanting some italian so came here as it was close to my hotel impressive menu selection chose the osso bucco with a side of pasta the osso was very tender and decent in flavor first time i have had it without the bone though they say they make their own sauce which was fair did not blow me away the pasta was a biggest disappointment for me texture and taste of a very cheap store bought brand suggest they either buy the best brand they can get or make your own one other thing i must mention on the tables they put the cheapest headache wine you can find in the us cupcake is all of maybe a bottle and pretty much considered trashy wine to top it off they want a bottle i would not give you cents for that stuff the restaurant itself is clean and comfortable from all appearances you would expect a much higher quality pasta and wine that is it fix those and your on your way up", "tasty tomato i generally as a rule hate tomatoes so the name threw me off but when we drove past it on the way to cafe amore which was closed we decided to drive back and try it it was packed on a monday night we were the fourth group in line luckily for us the wait was not too bad we were starving once seated we ordered our meals right away with an appetizer salad and we were told bread was on its way the salad came out it was fantastic cold crisp lettuce house made caesar dressing on an ice cold plate we demolished it but still no bread after minutes we asked about the bread our server said they were making it fresh and it would be right out perfect but the bread came out cold not room temperature cold the oil and vinegar accompanying it was tasty and we were hungry but why tell us its fresh when its cold finally our meals arrived all were very tasty fresh pasta homemade fresh sauces delicious mine however was missing the mushrooms so that was disappointing as it was the special and claimed to have bacon mushrooms and onions in it only bacon and onions made it into my dish but after the wait time i decided not to ask for them to sum up the experience service our server needed to be flagged down by us a few times tasteportion size overall i gave it a as there are no s but do not go there when super hungry or while in a hurry be prepared to wait", "went out for dinner saturday night with our friends jane and kees and enjoyed a little bit of vino and some fantastic food it is sometimes maybe always one of their weekend specials but i always enjoy the linguini pescadore a little spicy but great chunks of seafood and of course the pastas always perfect tania had the linguini w clams also a very tasty dish toss into the evenings recipe a few great friends and the result is fantastico", "cute and cozy little place nothing too adventurous but does simple north american home style italian cooking really well", "i really enjoyed eating here its a bit more pricey but it is worth it the second time i was here with a friend we had a very energetic server that was great to joke with the noise was moderate and easy to ignore other conversations i am not a huge fan of italian food mainly because i over pastad in university but the food is great definitely a place to take a date and have that awkward and obvious date staring tip get the other person you are with try to pronounce menu items always a good laugh", "tasty tomato is another neighbourhood italian restaurant located on the west side along with piccolino bistro that has been around for ages i have gone to this place many times when i was a youngin and i am happy to say it continues to thrive family owned and operated for over years do not let the drab exterior scare you away heck the off wine bottles sign monday to thursdays should be enticing you to step inside although its hilarious that its been up for as long as i can remember we decided to go for a late dinner tuesday night this is home cooked traditional comfort style italian food with a relaxed vibe and staff grab a table along the walls and you can car watch the night away the menu is absolutely massive literally one page full of appetizers pastas and entrees veal and chicken and the back page has all the drinks i do not think the menu has ever changed since i first set foot in tasty tomato haha amabile white wine italian wine who can resist we went with an amabile white wine which was light sweet and fruity caesar salad the caesar salad was one of their daily specials i have not ordered a caesar salads in ages but this one was quite good nothing special but the romaine lettuce was crisp and the croutons crunchy the dressing leaned towards the lighter side a health caesar so to speak lumache alla paragina escargot baked in a white wine garlic butter sauce you get six pieces of escargot bathed in butter and oven baked cheese an interesting appetizer to try i would have preferred less butter but the escargots were tasty lobster medallions another special for the night i knew i had to order it the moment the waitress said the words lobster and special those two words scream good eats the sauce was delicious light sweet and creamy the medallionsravioli was on point and there was a good amount of lobsta filling in each one my favourite dish of the night penne rustici italian sausage saut\u00e9ed in a pepper tomato sauce i had a bite and the sausage was a bit too dry however my buddy really liked his dish linguine salmone linguine noodles saut\u00e9ed with smoked salmon mushrooms and sundried tomatoes in a rosee sauce this one i preferred over the penne as the rosee sauce was tasty and the linguine absorbed the sauce well to give it a nice uniform taste do not expect to be blown away by tasty tomato but if you want simple homemade italian food done right this is the spot a tad on the pricey side but i have not had a bad meal yet bonus another good place to eat on the west end of town", "i was recently like an hour ago asked by one of my friends what my favourite restaurant in edmonton is the tasty tomato is probably not my favouritebut i mention it anyways because it is very under rated saying that i look at the other reviews and it by no means seems under rated as far as yelpers are concerned its a cozy spot especially in the winter time it is crowded as well at least the nights i have been the food is very good tastes home made like i am back in the old country it is not a high end place and the decor is not overly exciting its more of a family resto if you live in edmonton and have not been you should be ashamed of yourself if you are visiting edmonton its not in the downtown core but worth the venture out if you are in the mood for some good italian one other note you will not be able to hail a cab from the streets in that area so make sure you callyes i had an experience where i walked downtown from there in the middle of winter", "delicious a bit busy on a saturday night but all of us in line were given a glass of wine while we waitedamazing service was very friendly and the food came so quickly and was great we had the shrimp alfredo subbed in rose sauce and the pasta rusticcio very tasty and the pasta was cooked perfectly if i had an italian grandmother she would probably cook like this reader beware everything i know about italian families i have learned from tv there is a lot of variety but the menu is not overwhelming and on this night they had specials posted as well mainly seafood it got a bit loud in the small restaurant but it just seemed like dates and families really enjoying their meals and having a good laugh so nothing you can really complain about it was a really great meal and for me ranks up in the top edmonton italian restaurants its a bit of a hidden gem if you base it on locationexterior but delicious food that is reasonably priced we will be back", "true italian home cooking prepared by a wonderful family served by friendly staff and sometimes even the owner the exterior can seem a little rough but i prefer to say rustic just like the mouthwatering food a dish for any pasta lover with options ranging from veggie to veal with succulent variety of homemade sauces complimentary bread i tend to take advantage of but very attentive staff who are always willing to bring more it is a small dining area so plan to have reservations for people or try out your luck and wait for ten or so minutes it is well worth the wait the place has history and should stay a staple in edmonton for as long as possible", "great value and delicious food portions are generous ask for the bruschetta its not on the menu anymore but its so good the bread for the bruschetta is a big fluffy disc with garlicky bruschetta on top mmmm caesar salad is pretty standard calamari does not have the over breading of many eateries we have had the bolognaise vegetarian shrimp must admit they were skimpy on the shrimp there were yes i counted gnocchi in cheese sauce we appreciate the ambience tables are not overly crowded and the room itself is bright and quiet you never feel rushed", "owned by a true italian family everything is made in house as one walks in it is fairly casual and small the seatings are nicely laid out with a nice selection of wines at the bar without a fuss we were given glasses of ho and some bread with butter typical nothing special about the services if one had any allergies they are more than capable of suggesting something off the kitchen which was a nice touch for my elderly friend who is allergic to garlics the service were still fairly friendly i had the linguine portafino it was remarkable to the point that i even manage to finish the whole plate of my pasta so close to licking up the plate though the pasta was cooked perfectly to its softness the sauce was beautifully done by far the best italian restaurant i have been in a long time to top it all off i had the mango ice cream shaped like a flower smooth and silky my palate and whole being was well beyond satisfied will definitely return to savour more of its authentic italian food", "holy smokes i chose one helluva night to try and get a seat i walked in waited mins worth the wait by the way and there were three parties of two parties of and every other table filled i was on a tight time frame but still managed to get a latte a caesar salad and gnocchi with tomato cream sauce and get out in just over an hour that includes the minute wait i wish that i had had more time to just sit and take the restaurant in and have more to say but the food and service were stellar enough that ill make a reservation and take a date for sure impressive and a return is imminent", "went here for supper with a friend who lives in the neighborhood very good food appetizers were meatballs and calamari in tomato sauce both were good i had ravioli filled with ricotta cheese very good what you would expect from a good italian place barry had the special rainbow trout which he said was cooked perfectly and he would not shut up about how good and large the tirimsu was he also would not shut up about the dates vynil table cloths and how old the chairs ectopic were so they could use some updating to some things it is an old place and a place does not last decades if it is no good", "so i go there today for final exam carbs loading and legitif i wanted cheap noodles and canned dog poop i would have went somewhere elsethis is not what i expected at allwill not be going there again i asked for parpadelle and bolegnese sauce", "of us went and absolutely enjoyed our delicious meals great selection of entrees and the deserts were great i had the pear shaped ice creamexcellent friendly service", "food was great and so was the service even though we got there a bit late and stayed past closing time they were in no rush to get us out the door will come back for sure", "my favorite place for pasta family owned and operated i have been coming here for years and is yet to let me down only downside is that on the weekends there usually is a bit of a wait", "great lunch spot for italian food if you are in a hurry they will have different pastas to choose from and a meat to compliment if you wish its a nice family owned place and of course tasty dinner time you order off a menu and at lunch you go up to the counter to pick your food the restaurant is small with a limited amount of seating", "this is one of my favourite italian places in town do try the bruschetta absolutely the best i have ever had we love the caesar salad light crisp with an authentic oil and lemon dressing our favourite entree is linguine pescatore loaded with shrimp clams mussels excellent many of their pasta dishes feature house made pasta the tagliatelle is my favourite they are very amenable to changing pastas and or sauces so you get your favourites its one of the few places that carry our favourite bottle of wine half off weekdays its a family run restaurant small and no reservations the food is wonderful real italian home cooking", "i have been here before years ago for lunch they had a nice walk up bar where you ordered one of a few lunch time offerings that were played right there i thought it was fantastic i took my wife to experience what i remembered we went for dinner and were seated at a nice window seat we ordered the calamari and a few pasta dishes whatever i remembered from before this was certainly not it the calamari which was saut\u00e9d in a tomato sauce was flavourless i usually love squid no matter how it is prepared but it usually needs more support than what this dish was giving it the mains were forgettable literally it has been a little while and i can not remember what we order all i can remember was that both dishes were beyond salty my wife loves salt so it was only a little more salty than her liking but for me it was like my mouth was on fire before you ask we did mention all this to the server they were polite about it as we were we also took what was left of our meals home so we could add pasta and sauce to adjust the taste i walked away full but dissatisfied it was an ok experience but i do not plan on ever returning", "i have been once for lunch before so i thought id get some take out this time for lunch the food is good but the service is lacking as i walked up to the serving table the waitress acknowledged the person that entered right after me the owner came out and asked what i wanted without being told about the choices i picked the first one with various pasta shapes and was told its the most popular he offered me salad which is just lettuce with italian dressing i had to ask for the bread before i left or i would not have gotten any the waitress asked me if i was paying card without even telling me the total owed after i paid i thanked them but was not acknowledged once payment was received hopefully their dinner service makes up for the crappy lunch service", "tasty tomato is a staple of west edmonton and for good reason this family owned business is a perfect example of what good italian food should be it is flavourful freshly hand made and aromatic the tomato sauce at tasty tomato is unlike any other i love the creaminess of the sauce and when mixed with cheese it is to die for the place is smaller so id highly recommend a reservation ahead of time parking can be tricky in their lot but park on the street and you will be fine order anything its all delicious and incredible", "tasty tomato i love pasta all kinds of pasta i can not think of a pasta i did not like but my love must be in moderation so when i have a hankering for pasta i am particular the tasty tomato is one of my top choices there is a little parking lot right outside it is centrally located its both roomy and cozy the service is personal and unobtrusive the food is simply delicious i had a rotini with chicken mushroom and spinach in a creamy parmesan sauce the portions are big so i could not finish it but my companion did and he loved it as much as i did others are my table had the linguine vongole and the chicken pasta with lemon butter all was delightful monday to thursday bottles of wine are half price bread comes as a starter with oil and balsamic the prices are pretty reasonable too", "we stopped for a quick bite to eat on the way home from groceries i do not know why it took so long for us to come eat here but now its definitely a huge favorite and we can not wait to come back as soon as quarantine is lifted they had the tables very spaced out and everything was cleaned and sanitized as guests left we felt safe and satisfied with their covid precautions the food is amazing the bruschetta is the best i have ever had the bread is fresh and crispy and between my sister and i it was gone in a flash as you can see by the photo we were so into it that we forgot to take any photos we also had the pasta feature of the night that had spicy italian sausage and mushrooms the calamari and a bottle of wine such an amazing meal", "this is one of my favourite italian places in town do try the bruschetta absolutely the best i have ever had we love the caesar salad light crisp with an authentic oil and lemon dressing our favourite entree is linguine pescatore loaded with shrimp clams mussels excellent many of their pasta dishes feature house made pasta the tagliatelle is my favourite they are very amenable to changing pastas and or sauces so you get your favourites its one of the few places that carry our favourite bottle of wine half off weekdays its a family run restaurant small and no reservations the food is wonderful real italian home cooking", "i have been going to this place for over years and its never disappoints if they had twice as many tables it would still be full expect to wait and bring cash a simple menu with enough choices to satisfy the house wine is great and make sure to have dessert worth every penny the parking is terrible though", "this evening we were invited to our community volunteer appreciation dinner at our very own neighborhood classic italian eatery beside our group of nearly volunteers the restaurant was a full house for a tuesday night service was friendly prompt and on point for our large group alex and i shared a simple caprese appetizer that had a very unique presentation the dish was finished with a few capers for that perfect amount of saltiness this restaurant has been around for years and the other guests at our table seem to know their way around the menu everyone ordered their familiar favorites and the traditional lasagna gnocchi and ravioli dishes seem to continue to please all palates the generous portions had perfectly cooked pasta and fresh zesty sauces we surprisingly had room left over to share a coconut mango sorbet a pleasant way to end with a dairy free alternative their house promotion is half price wine bottles monday through thursday vino surely be back thanks tasty tomato", "very nice service on the phone i called in to place a to go order and i arrive to pick it up was cooly greeted by a young lady at the front the look on her face when i arrived was not very pleasant at all ok i let that go i paid for my food and gave a generous tip its all about the tip in these days it seems she literally shoved my order in front of me no thank you nothing i smiled and said there is a little something on there for you as she handed me my receipt this is rich she actually rolled her eyes at me no i will not be back i can understand someone having a bad day but this was ridiculous if she worked for me she would have been sent home food was just ok tasted like the chicken parm was made ahead and reheated funny aftertaste and small portions of everything the service of you want to call it that was disgraceful do yourself a favor and skip this place clearly your business and tip is not appreciated", "tasty tomato is what in italy is called trattoria or spaghetteria a solid good place to get a good meal with a lively easy atmosphere in fact do not come to tasty tomato in my humble opinion for anything else not that other dishes prepared are not good in fact the last time i came i had the veal scalloppine which was very good but for me on that night i was hungry it was not enough i would have loved one or two more filets of veal so with the above said i have had the bigolini allamatriciana fettucine al salmone and linguine with polpette and all have been al dente and as good as i would make at home very nice portion without being so much that you can not finish it and if you ask they do go lighter on the sauce for you the only thing that may put people off is the parking however this too is not a problem since you can park on the other side of the lot tt has for the evening time anyway without a problem will continue to return given that the quality is worth it", "we were excited to try this place as it is walking distance and we had heard great things about it from a neighbor best italian food in the city pros ambiance the restaurant is cozy simple decor nothing fancy the outside of the restaurant is unassuming history you can tell from the framed articles on the wall the restaurant has been around for many years the owner who was featured in the articles was walking around talking to people and seating guests the whole time we were there price we got a bottle of wine plus an additional glass each appetizer mains and desert for cons the food was just oknothing special and i doubt id go back for any other reason than convenience i have had the exact dish i ordered garlic shrimp and linguine at the local family owned italian place where we used to live in the states and it was better there the calamari which was saut\u00e9ed not fried was chewy and fishy my husbands dish pasta with three cheeses and a creamy ros\u00e9 sauce was meh desert was decent ice cream dipped in torrone oh the free bread was phenomenal think a cross between a soft buttery dinner roll and focaccia it was busy the whole time we were there on a friday night so obviously people do like the food for us though it was very average italian we also stood standing in the entry way waiting for a table for about minutes and no one greeted us until we were first in line which was a little confusing i assume the restaurant is too small to require a hostess but an acknowledgement by any of the staff would have been nice", "this is the kind of place you can easily pass by and not think anything of it tasty tomato is on stony plain road and about street the road is pretty busy the building for the restaurant looks a little plain and run down being on stony plain road one might even assume a little sketchy and the name tasty tomato italian eatery it kind of sounds like a cheesy kid friendly italian restaurant like an east side marios or boston pizza yeah that is not at all what this restaurant is at all the location is a bit strange its kind of the only restaurant nearby except delux in the crestwood a few blocks down but tasty tomato is definitely worth stopping at the restaurant to my surprise was not at all a loud family restaurant it was a very nice kind of romantic restaurant any restaurant with white table linens and real candles kind of gives me a romanticnice evening out unlike a lot of nice evening out restaurant that would normally because my heart to drop when the bill comes tasty tomato is really reasonably priced my friend and i got here at pm when the restaurant opened it was a tuesday night so it was not busy and we were able to get a table on a friday or saturday night or if you were looking to eat at a normal time we just happened to be in the area at pm our server was very friendly and prompt with service we got some delicious bread with olive oil and vinegar to start as my friend said who ever thought to dip bread in olive oil and vinegar was a genius tasty tomato is a locally run restaurant and there is a sign when you enter saying the pasta sauces are all made in house that day without additive preservatives message etc the pasta itself is also homemade not just dried pasta from the grocery store and while i am not italian at all i could definitely tell that this was the real deal i got the salmone linguine which is smoked salmon saut\u00e9ed mushrooms sun dried tomatoes and linguine in a rose sauce the dish was delicious and the portions were pretty bigyou definitely will not leave hungry my friend got the veal scaloppini and loved it as well together our meal was about we did not have wine or anything but we had a lot of delicious food its funny because i used to pass by this restaurant driving to school every day but i never thought to stop in to quote the incomparable cher if i could turn back time the tasty tomato is in a strange spot from the outside it does not look like much but on the inside you will find a really nice restaurant with friendly staff and delicious food the tasty tomato italian eatery is definitely worth a stop if you are looking for good pasta and italian food in yeg", "i went looking for italian but not one of the chains or big shots our st anniversarywanted something very good but new for us we found it at tasty tomato happy years tasty the service and food were beyond amazing fresh cooked mom does an amazing job on the sauces as her son who manages the restaurant now says she is still in charge of them lol pasta fresh and excellent veal limone superb fettucini carbonara was a special the night we were there was excellent my husband said his tiramisu was the best he has ever had we will definitely be backsoon as prices were very reasonable thank you for our peach grappa on the house for our anniversary", "after all these years i finally got to try this place out it is worth the hype a hole in the wall place that is been open for like years everything is cooked fresh and its amazing if you like cafe amore bistro you will like this place you will like the prices better too much more affordable i got a caprese salad and the alfredo it was delicious i was very full afterwards food came out quickly and the portions were just right i finished it all so did my friends there was no plate with leftovers the ambience is very homey and comfortable all the tables were filled we almost did not get a reservation but thankfully they were able to squeeze us in there is parking on the street and at the restaurant itself ill definitely be back took me almost years of living in edmonton to go here but i am glad i did", "tasty tomato has been in its little location forever and while it does not get all the pomp and celebration that other restaurants serving more contemporary italian do it is a solid and reliable restaurant that delivers amazing quality and value with exceptional service this is a great spot for couples families and even taking the grandparents everyone i have ever taken her has loved it the place is clean and tables are turned and cleaned quickly they do not take reservations but if you have a large group they will try an accommodate it the menu covers some salads and starters a long list of pasta dishes all cooked al dente and some secondi mains and dessert the wine list is big enough and reasonably priced dinner for two with a bottle of wine is under i am always glad i have gone and like i said if you want a good plate of pasta and some vino for you and your famiglia get yourself in there", "does not accept gift cards waiter could care less whether or not your satisfied with meal only one staff member seemed happy the rest were not", "ordered the perogie nachos there was supposed to be beef on it i found tiny strips on the whole thing boston pizza is usually good but this one is not great probably would go to the chilis next time sorry jim", "terribly understaffed on christmas eve after clearing a table of glasses and other debris from previous customers we seated ourselves and waited minutes later we still had not even been acknowledged so we left less than half the tables were occupied and most of the empty ones had not been cleared", "the service is pretty quick when you order and go pick it up i also like the delivery option as sometimes you get sick of ordering in pizza and they have lots of menu items to chose from", "stopped in at the bps on ave and st for my nephews birthday this is still the best restaurant with decent food for kids i do not have kids of my own thank god but this is where i would take them if i had any the food is always consistently good but you are never going to find anything too out of ordinary bps does not take chances which is fine as its their brand i had a oz ny strip with veggies and a mixed greens salad i was really happy with it i do not have a single bad thing to say but its just bps so i can not give it more than a too humdrum in the big picture", "it has a lounge side and a restaurant side the pizza is good meals are ok the lunch quesadilla was horrible as it seemed to be filled with fake cheese and just a little chicken no peppers they do have beer specials food other than pizza is ok casual dining servers were very pleasant free parking in the mall lot", "lived in capilano area my whole life this bps used to be a great place to get beers wings have lunch with my family the menu was good too but in the last few years its really gone downhill poor service greasy processed food too much dressing on everything i admit in a pinch we do order takeout from here perogy pizza is good but certainly not our go to spot they have the opportunity to be a great spot in the neighborhood but it pretty much sucks there now too bad i used to really like bps", "terrible service tonight at this location took mins until server faith came to our table after sitting she never once filled our drinks or checked on us once food is over priced at boston pizza for a basic salad etc", "ordered online for delivery the food was tasteless the spicy food lacked its spicy so much i wondered if they put the spice in at all the lasagna lost its taste plus it appeared they only filled the container half full terrible place never again", "the staff are always super friendly when i am craving something a little off the diet plan the boston brute always hits the spot", "located on the east side of edmonton next to the sawmill restaurant it is an average boston pizza place they have a bar side and a restaurant side the bar side has an enclosed patio sandwiches are ok pizza is quite good i asked for a salad with mine and got a pile of white lettuce unfortunately they have a patio but service is slow its an alright place", "i have been here many a time for family dinner out the service is always good despite being a little slow sometimes it seems they are often over worked but that being said the food quality is always great definitely a shout out to the cooks chefs here never have i had a bad meal i would recommend this place highly if your coming to enjoy some time at the table with friends or family i feel that even with the slightly slow service the food makes up for it its reliably excellent", "i can not say enough good things about this place the food people and atmosphere are wonderful a few favourites are the wiseguy and sophia loren sandwiches the pollo vittoria and cappricosa pizzas and of course the deliciously italian tiramisu the crusts also sandwich doughs are crispy yet chewy cooked up in seconds so even on busy nights you do not wait long fresh basil and real italian mozzarella make this a fresh and completely enjoyable dining experience the pizzas are light and never leave you feeling stuffed although you feel you have indulged i have never been to naples but am going next year i am excited to compare i disagree that the pizzas are overpriced i can share one they advertise it as that but it usually comes out bigger with my boyfriend and split a drink for under and that is plenty for us anyways also keep in mind that they use fresh italian ingredients and prepare it right to order i eat here at least twice a month and have never been disappointed", "it is not real neopolitan pizza in the real vpn way so i am disapointed in their branding no wood fired oven in sight but i am a trained pizzaiolo so i can be the great critic other than that the do a wonderful job and for most people they will be very happy great pizza fresh salads and a great wine list mangia", "famoso salad is good but the menu lacks gluten free options pizza according to my friends is good i do not like that you order at the cashier and they just bring you your food no waiter service for food just drinks", "this place is always on the list when the whole where do you want to eat game is played the food is hot fresh and just mouthwatering when i am keeping it simple i will go with the margarita pizzetta a smaller version of their regular pizza and a bowl of the tomato bisque simple flavours done well the tomato sauce on the pizza is not something you want falling off the top you will be mopping that stuff up if you are looking for a bit of variety try one of the seasonal pizzas on the appetizer front there are a few really great selections including my fave the prosciutto wrapped mozza baked in their moppable pizza sauce amazing just amazing we have also never had a bad drink there great atmosphere and once you get the feel for the place and learn how to order you are golden", "i love coming to famoso the food is delicious i had the tomato soup server with a piece of bread and it was very yummy the pizzeta has a good size for one person since its a thin crust the tiramisu is to die for it is just so delicious they have now full service so get a table and the server will come to take your order staff is very friendly and will give good suggestions if you are undecided on what to order there is plenty of parking since this place is located in the south common mall", "quick service overly friendly staff but the pizza i was recommended was a disaster might come back", "the first time i tried famoso it was after the earthquake in japan they were having a whole day to support the efforts in japan they gave of their proceeds to the funds i was amazed and knew immediately that i would love this restaurant and i was right i have been a few times now and always have a great experience however if it is your first time it may seem a bit confusing you sit down take out the menu and decide on what you want that is easy but when you are ready to order you go up to the counter and tell them your table number and place your order there are still waiters who serve you its a kind of strange set up but it never bothered me anyways on to the important part the food everytime i go i order a bowl of the fire roasted tomato bisque its only and it is fabulous its spicy and has a huge spoonful of feta cheese in the middle you get flatbread on the side to dip in it is amazing i also will order their mediterranean flatbread to share with a friend it comes with hummus and tzatziki i am not sure if i spelt that right it tastes fresh and delicious i know i should eat pizza at a pizzeria but i have yet to try it its hard because i fell so hard for their soup all my friends order the pizza and i have never heard a complaint the pizzas have super thin crust and are covered in yummy toppings this however is not where the meal ends do not forget about desert at famoso save room for it trust me i was so full the last time i went but really curious about trying the tiramisu the waitress convinced me to give it a try but i got it to go when i got home and took a bite of this tiramisu i was literally in heaven melt in your mouth flavorful delicious eat every last crumb tiramisu if you like tiramisu at all make sure to give this a try it was the best tiramisu i have ever had ever as you can tell from all the capital letters and exclamation marks in my review i am obviously excited about this restaurant i was just there and i already want to go straight back and i might just do that ashley marie", "i stopped into famoso for a quick lunch today while spending the afternoon shopping in south common having only been here once before during a busy friday night before attending a movie i was again very happy with my experience the food speaks for itselfi love the intertwining of classic italian pizzas margherita proscuitto and pepperoni you would expect with interesting and unusual pizzas like the don andeas with corn salsa avocado and cilantrotruly original the caprese salad is also utterly delicious what more could you ask for then fresh mozzarella tomatoes basil and olive oil a simple but memorable delight the service is either seat yourself or standard wait to be seated but regardless it enlists you to order at the counter which i love you can either dash to the register for a quick on the go meal or take your time with group of friends i like the ability to control the pace of your dinning experience my two visits to famoso have both involved a quick delivery of food friendly and efficient customer service and an exquisite meal i appreciate the effective system famoso has in place to deliver customers their food in a timely manner with excellent quality i will absolutely be returning and look forward to my next visit if not for the caprese salad alone", "what a great concept i think i have finally found my edmonton pizza spot the decor is contemporary and comfortable it is basically set up so you are greeted you decide what you want from the menus at the table and then go up to the front to order your food and drink they will bring the food to you when it is ready they have endless combinations of pizza wine and gelato the pizza is hand stretched and baked at degrees fahrenheit for seconds hence why we got our food so fast the pizza is so well made that even if you take it home for lunch the next day it reheats really well and is almost as yummy as the night before i had the quattro formaggi because i am sucker for anything with mounds of cheese my only complaint at least about this location i have yet to try the others is that the place is somewhat small and usually really busy because of the movie theatre close by that does not bother me but when it is outside and you are crowded in the teeny tiny waiting area by the front door it gets really uncomfortable very quickly since i was so cold i opted out for gelato but i can not wait to come back in the summer and try it", "i was pretty impressed with this place that considering the quality of food they serve that my friend and i were able to get two drinksa full saladand two pizzas for under fifty dollars the salad was phenomenal with big chunks of bacon and parmesan cheese and the pizza was cooked to perfection the service however was another story altogether we came in at and the place was dead but we still had to deal with an absentee waiter my friend went about half the meal without a refill and he never came over to see how the food was after it was dropped off we actually flagged down a different waitress who was more then happy to refill our drinks and bring us extra plates while i could see the first guy over chatting with the chefs and other customers to be honest i had initially thought maybe we had encountered him close to the end of his shift and he had gone home then at the end of the meal we added a third waitress to the mix when we could not find the first lady to bring us the debit machine to pay for our meal not a huge deal but it was mildly irritating and i hate to see when one staff is having to pick up the slack for somebody else who is not pulling their weight food was phenomenal though and we will definitely be back again", "so this was my first time eating here a friend and myself went to have supper here prior to going i heard how great of a place this was and i thought to myself let us give a shot my friend had been here prior it was so nice to be greeted by who it seemed to be the supervisorboss on shift very pleasant and helpful staff very professional staff i ordered a ham pineapple pizzetta individual pizza and i chose to have the gorgonzola salad with feta cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing on the side everything came out and tasted fantastic the only thing when my pizza came out there was no cheese on the pizza the waitress brought it to my attention and asked if i specifically ordered it like that and i responded that i did not and she offered to go back and have it re made i went into all that detail for this reason after i started eating the boss supervisor came over apologized again for the mistake and asked if there was anything she could do or if we needed anything at all just to let her know to sum it up my experience with the food service etc was a overall good one i will definitely go back", "i am a seriosuly big fan of this place sometimes i feel like a regular i know the owner from business and can say that this is my favourite location of all the chainsfor these reasons food and service the food and service are always consistently great my usual order consists of a caramel macchiato as a drink very delicious very homey feeling you get from drinking it sweet bbq chicken is my main course intensly delicious the sauce combined with the fresh ingredients make for quite the treat these pizzas are thin crust so not only are they delicious they are pretty good for you as well you do not get full on just the dough nor does the dough take away from the flavour and to finsih ooff my meal i get the nutella pizza its so good its incredible the only downside is that you might get dirty eating it also it is much more doughy than the other pizzas as for the service this one is always speedy i always order everything i am going to eat all at once so that there is no hold up and with this location it holds true everything is brought in a timely manner you can also prepray so once you are done you can just leave and not have to line up to pay great idea i always prepay ambiance the whole atmosphere of this place is very chill and modern yet homey has a very type of cafe feel to it it is the choice restaurant for my friends and i when we get together its great for large parties we are able to socialize and drink without music drowing out what were saying the drinks are moderately priced though i am not so much of a fan of their alcoholic drinks id much prefer their luxury coffee i have not given this place a five star because there is room for improvement such as the alcoholic drinks or the fact that all the venues are small and crowded especially this venue everytime i go its always full with people waiting because there is a small amount of tables to seat people comfortably i just wish they would have decided to go with bigger places or expand somehow but either way since the service is so quick people come in and out quickly enough", "absolutely terrible soggy pizza just kidding perfect portions the create your own toppings were just right decently priced service was great", "service was good and i like the space its clean the pizza is ok i mean its waay better than boston pizza or panagopolous but not as good as i was expecting it to be the tomato sauce is both a bit to acidic and sweet which makes a weird combo also its soggy and i get its thin crust but it weighs down at the center and the dough is damp its one of the better eating options at south common and not so bad that i will not be back but not so good that it will be a place i will frequent", "the famousa salad is amazing has so much flavor and almost all your food groups nice and filling i also really enjoyed there americano very clean crisp expresso taste only complaint is if you go when busy service is slow worth the wait though enjoy this amazing salad at least once a week", "yummy mozza balls excellent gelatto fast service", "came in for lunch today and it seems service here is lacking although most staff here are for the most part chipper and happy to be of service it seems chatting amongst themselves had a higher priority today we sat ourselves as directed by the sign at the front but continued to wait as staff were talking to each other they did glance over but no contact was made or a be right with you they were not busy at this time food did come out in a timely manner good value for food and lots to choose from", "had funghi pizza and tiramisu at this location surprisingly i actually liked this pizza better than the ones i got at unas in calgary tiramisu is good but a bit sweet for me i prefer the tiramisu i had in tiramisu bistro", "amazing the staff is fantastic and friendly and always easy to find the menu is fantastic and since you order at the bar they provide a well designed notepad for you so you do not forget your order especially for multiple people our wait time for pizza could not have been longer than ten minutes it was fresh piping hot and gourmet i am lactose intolerant so at first i was glad for the marinara pizza that does not include cheese but then i saw that they offer free substitution of daiya vegan mozzarella for any of their cheeses i was euphoric dining out can be hard when you are lactose intolerant and i was thrilled that famoso offered an option that meant i could enjoy nearly their whole menu thanks famoso", "closest thing to italian pizza without being in rome the margarita pizza is to die for if you thought the flavours of gelato was tough to choose from if you ever travel to rome its ten times harder chai latte gelato orange sorbert vanilla bean are all delicious", "i love famoso in downtown edmonton so i was stoked to try the location on the south side famoso is a great place for a date or some family time i love the fact that you take your order up to the till it adds something new and exciting to the restaurant experience famoso has delicious pizzas and the patio is fantastic i love that their is gelato is delicious famoso is a really great place to visit if you are in neighbourhood you should stop in", "i am not convinced that famoso needs to seem so upscale this location is overly busy for the size and the service is slowed considerably for this reason alone but i adore famoso so going here can not be too wrong it is a great place to go right before a movie at the south common theatre i normally order a pizzetta and a salad and its often just the right amount of food for me i kind of miss when it was not a full service restaurant but the food is still delicious so nothing wrong there", "i can not believe it took me so long to try famoso this place is a gem the food is delicious i love the format of ordering at the counter and being served at the table its easy and efficient we had two pizzas and the appetizer with the three dips bruschetta an olive tapenade and the artichoke and it was all fantastic", "the pizzas at famoso are delicious we end up going here at least once every couple of months i mourn the winter special meatballs appetizer coming off the menu i do not know what it was about those coupled with the marinara sauce but they were beyond awesome the pizzas typically have a great toppingssaucedough ratio its never fun when your pizza is so doughy that there is no way you can taste anything elseor when the pizza is so overwhelmed by sauce and toppings that it falls apart i have tried a variety of different toppings at famoso and have not been disappointed by any of them if you are looking for a guilty indulgence to cap off your meal try the nutella pizza so deliciously bad for you", "delicious the balls of cheese in the sweet tomato sauce appetizer is to die for and usually the first thing we dig into i remember reading on one of their menus that they actually import a special type of tomato that is less acidic and make for a very sweet end effect my favorite pizza right now is the san andreas i believe its called slices of avocado and dizzles of a creamy white sauce served with a slice of lime make this by far unique the fire roasted dough that is ready in an amazing seconds is great on the taste buds and makes it almost impossible to stop from eating the one thing that helps me is trying to save room for their amazing flavors of gelato available the flavors showcased are extremely unique and i have yet to see any kind of replication anywhere else in the city the atmosphere tops off the entire experience and the sweet girls behind the counter are always welcoming at least at the downtown location the only semi negative thing i could say is the amount of plain pizza dough slices that they accompany with almost everything its a little bit of carb overkill i always end up leaving a ton which seems like a waste or taking it home with me for later which i generally never come to finishing off", "mmmm probably one of my favorite casual dining places in the city the food is always fresh and delicious the service good and its a great place for lunchdinner when you have kids in tow i have been to both this location downtown and sherwood park and they are all equally clean and well run but this location in particular has a really friendly and pleasant manager who seems to just float around the restaraunt and make people feel welcome so thanks tall moustache guy for always making my experience just a little better", "this is my go to place for supper before a movie all the ingredients are great have not had any food here that was not good if its your first time ger them to give you a rundown on how it works and what to expect the pizza is super thin crust and it might be off putting if its not what you expect but once you eat it it changes what you expect i hardly ever have pizza anywhere else", "i went here of course for the pizza but has to say that the dough of the pizza was too chewy also had polpette al forno meat balls they come with tomato sauce and two kind of cheeses sadly for me out of those two cheeses the one that really kicked the flavor were just crumbs in my plate food is okay and service is good", "great pizza best in edmonton", "famoso is a new for me concept in pizza kind of like the new burger places smashburger and bbp where you place your order and then sit down while the order is delivered to your table the experience was very pleasant with a very courteous staff the food itself was good not great for a nice thin crust pizza the center was soggy and disappointing probably the sauce has too much liquid but overall a good pizza with decent taste and good service ill b back", "come early it gets busy fast even on a wednesday night do not forget you can always get take out great for a lunch on the run", "ok so forgive me because i can not remember the name of the pizza pies i devoured here with my dining mate and yes i do mean devoured but it was something very italian and fancy one was the siciliana which might just be the name of my first born daughter the slice was so good because of its proximity to south common theatres this is the perfect pre flick dinner haunt in addition to super speedy degree oven cooked pizza dessert here is a selection of icy cold gelato flavours like chai om nom nom our waiter for the evening was really funny and nice thanks for being so understanding when my mouth was full of cheese and i could not answer your question and not laughing too hard at me i definitely recommend famoso for its massive selection of pizzas not just your typical cheese pepperoni vegetarian and cool low lit dining atmosphere mama mia", "love this placestaff is awesome and friendly and food is quick and delicious both inside and skip the dishesa bit pricey but you pay for a quality pizza so i do not mind it i have been here countless times and always had a terrific experiencealso shoutout to the young blonde guy that works there he is super sweet and always recognizes me", "i love this place its my favourite for pizza and it has been since i first started eating here this also is the best location in the city i usually get the siciliana and if i want something different i get the lunch size with a bowl of the first roasted tomato bisque on the side if you have not tried that soup you should its amazing this is also the place that got me hooked on nutella the nutella pizza dessert is to die for the service is great if something is not right they make it right i do not mind going up to the counter to order because you get full table service from then on out it gets a little crunched on busier days but hey the staff does a remarkable job of managing things i will continue to eat here as long as i continue to eat pizza", "great thin crust real italian style pizza which is a very nice change from pizza found at most other north american chains the menu has a great selection of different flavours from traditional to unique and the pizzas are always served hot and fresh the servers are friendly and helpful here minor hiccup we had last time was our appetizer arrived prior to our drinks but once our server realized this she apologized profusely besides the pizza i love the gelato and sorbetto you can not beat either the nutella or the limone in my opinion", "if you are in south common and craving pizza this is the place to come they have something to satisfy everyone i usually go for something with garlic carmelized onions or mushrooms famoso has no shortage of flavor and even spicy pizzas the pizzetta size is perfect for one person but you can get a tomato bisque or one of the many salad options as a side one thing i do not understand is their need to cash out at the bar we are early eaters so we are usually there around pm and always on a weeknight every damn time there are workers scattered around the bar why do i car because we actually like to sit at the bar good view of whatever is on the tv i do not know what the owners were thinking when they planned this place without an office oh and for the robbers out there this is the perfect place to come i myself already know the time they count their money and that they are naive enough to count it right in the open right by the door but anyway id probably give them stars if it wast for the counting of money at the bar and the staff always huddled around it with their lunch bags and what not the bar is there for customers who enjoy eating at the bar or is it not rant over", "the pizza is great of course but i am addicted to the famoso salad nothing beats it i have been to this location a number of times and will continue to go back the food is always amazing and i have never had any problems with them getting an order wrong their process does leave little to be desired having to get up from your table and go place your order at the counter then head back to your seat and wait for your food but its worth it and it gives you a chance to check out their amazing gelato selection the reason for only stars is based mostly on my last visit my mom has wanted to go their for a long time and so we went for dinner on mothers day it started out great the server was attentive and and answered questions however after we ordered it went terribly down hill we could see our server still serving other tables but he did not come back to us even once another server brought us our food as well as the water that we ordered at the same time as our pizza salad but never made it to our table he did not check on us even once when we were done our meal we just sat there with empty plates in fact we sat there with empty plates for a good minutes after we were done and finally had to physically flag him down and ask for our bill he silently almost dismissively put the bill on the table and did not even acknowledge the empty plates or ask how the meal was and walked away i actually felt as though i had done something to offend him in some way ill be back for sure but this one visit has soured me a little", "so yummy vesuvio siciliana and spicy thai are my personal favourites also the banana dessert can not remember the name is to die for gelato and tomato basil soup are also delicious definitely recommend", "love love the food my all time favorite is the tomato bisque soup and the small wise guy sandwichmmmmm i also love the italian soda the only thing i am not in love with is the order at the counterit just seems so weird and impersonal in a way as they have people serve you drinks and bring your food so that is why the four stars", "just terrible service you walk in and have to find your own seat and then go back up to order and from then on its full service they will be sure to tell you watch for it well not today not even almost they forgot our order completely all the orders were taking a long time a long time we only noticed ours was missed when a table that came in minutes after us got served first i would think that even an almost full service joint would notice somehow that a customer was not being served maybe they almost did or maybe it was our fault because we did not know who to flag down to ask if our food was almost ready they did not even do anything to try to make up for the gaff we walked out while they were still trying to figure out what happened obviously more concerned about the process than the customer they did not almost lose a customer for life they have lost them", "i am from out of town so do not really know which are good restaurants to go to so just let everyone else pick we went on a fri night but really it was only because my sil had a groupon i think it was everyone is first time at a famoso location and it was busy they said there was a min wait but it was probably half that over all an interesting concept but the location seemed small and like they cramed a whole buch of stuff in i have read all the reviews and agreed with most the good and bad first as for the ordering system i honestly did not mind it but since we had such great service i do not understand why they could not take our order instead of us going back up to the counter unique but weird atmosphere dim but no trouble reading the menu or seeing our food open and airy but we were in the back corner so not crowded like i would assume it might feel at the front the pizza was made in the open not in the back that was cool price a bit more then what i would expect more then fast food but less the a typical sit down but not crazy my drink meal dessert tax was about tip that is for one and there was of us food drinks apparently the wine my husband and sil ordered was really good oaky and full of flavor i am not partial to red so i did not really like it to strong and in your face for me i had the gorgonzola walnut salad full size first i had never had or heard of that particular cheese even though i am a huge cheese lover except blue gross no it does not taste like ranch so i was super surprised that gorgonzola is basically blue p i made an exclamation over it and the waitress was ready to take it back and have them re make it but that always seems like a waste to me so i said i would just pick it off but the salad really needed something more so the waitress ended up getting me some ramano cheese there was also cranberries which were yum the vinaigrette was blah over all i would never order it again even with different cheese everyone else had pizza and seemed to enjoy it though i had a bit of hubbys and found it soggy and not that appetizing so for me the food was like stars i will probably end up giving it another chance though because id really like to try the bisque and the sandwiches look really good but mostly ill try it again but at a different location because one is opening up blocks from our house and the service at this one was great the service is really why i am being generous with the stars but you really have to suck to get get stars from me", "waited mins for a table that i could see is clear and the host is doing everything except direct tables the whole waiting area is full and empty tables are not being seated quite bad customer service overall", "honestly i think this is one of the most over rated places going pizza is mediocre and the prices are a little steep we have been a couple of times and like most chain restaurants it ends up being disappointing do not see myself returning", "the food is always fresh and amazing my favorite pizza place in the city staff are very friendly", "some friends and i went here for dinner tonight on a friday night the place was pretty packed we had about a minute wait for a table probably a little bit less than that i normally get the small pizza and soup combo because the tomato soup here is awesome this time i thought id shake tradition and just get a full pizza i got the primavera pizza which had red onions olives roasted red peppers roasted mushrooms artichoke hearts and mozzarella the primavera is a pizza bianca which is a white sauce pizza although its not really a rich cheesy sauce its apparently a basic olive oil garlic and oregano which is also delicious i am not an olive person but recently i have been enjoying them more and more and this pizza was no exception there was a nice balance of sweet salty savoury and smokey flavours to this pizza the regular pizzas are huge for one person the size of a dinner plate and could definitely be shared between two people then again when you are in italy this size of pizza is what you would get and the crust is nice and thin so why not do a little eat pray love action and have an entire pizza i had not eaten anything all day so i was quite hungry by the time we had supper at pm despite the fact i was full after i still could justify getting a scoop of the salted caramel dark chocolate gelato because uh its gelato service was a bit slower than normal but they were also really busy tonight silly me i thought people would stay home but apparently other people like having delicious pizza on good friday i have been back before so there is a ill come back again", "we ordered take out from here nearly a year ago and for no real reason just had not found our way backuntil there was a groupon that is this location seems to always be busy and even on a wednesday night we had a few minutes wait before we were able to get a table that said it was a very comfortable level of busy the kind that makes you realize you have chosen a great restaurant not the kind that leaves you wondering whenif you will ever get to eat the wait staff are amazing friendly and efficient and we appreciated how they took the time to explain the menu and the ordering process for those of you new to famoso after being seated you walk over to the till to place your initial order with your table number i believe that afterwards everything is full service and ordered directly from your table with the groupon we ordered an appetizer mediterranean flatbread one regular pizza spicy thai and one newseasonal pizza moo shu bbq duck the flatbread was a huge portion with ample amounts of tzatziki and hummus to share although i just could not seem to get enough of it the pizzas were approximately and we were informed by the waitress that normally people order one each that said we were already committed to two anyway so why not i tend to be a plain jane when it comes to my pizza but the menu at famoso has lots of exciting options to choose from and a build your ownadditions option for the pizza artist while i was a little nervous to be stretching my boundaries both options were very tasty and very filling we came home with an entire pizza what i loved about this place the environment was very comfortable again i am glad i was there on a wednesday the food was wonderfully delicious and the service was as good as it gets well most certainly be back maybe even just for the flatbread", "i was a patron of the original location downtown within a month of them opening so i have been a fan for a long time i do not make it out to this location too often but its a beautiful place much larger and a bit nicer than the original my wife loves their salads but i stick to the vesuvio pizza its nice and spicy just the way i like it i have also had the flatbread which is great and their tiramisu is to die for the last time we were here the server misheard what my wife asked for and ended up bringing her a bottle of water which was open and she did not seem to be interested in taking it off the bill that is been our only issue here great pizza great place definitely a good time can be had here", "the one joint that does not need to be fancy is a pizza place famoso is all hype in a nice setting the pizza can not even support its toppings i do not mind thin crust but this was just weak pizza and over priced went once and that was it for me", "pizza was great perfect napoleon style and with some great gelato to go with it will be back again soon just wish they had some chilli oil to go with to add a little spice", "to sum it up this place was over crowded the wait time was long and the food sucks we got burnt pizza with no toppings so we pretty much paid to eat burnt crust never going to famoso again", "since the food is what its mostly about let us get everything else out of the way service stellar friendly helpful and dare i say attractive price cheap cheap cheap wallet friendly from start to finish so pony up kids decor who cares its clean trendy open and it smells delicious inside the patio is a great escape as well and pairs nicely with a cocktail wink wink food let us do this bare in mind i am doing this on a full stomach in a particularly salty mood with a three year old jumping around like my living room is an olympic gymnastics practice room my point i am being only slightly biased and completely objective pizza is delicious and i hate this word with a passion nothing comes from a frozen state its tradition thin crust with foldability and the cheese is to die for literally i almost got hit by a car running to the front doors id die for this cheese i order it in every form available for purchase appetizers pizza salad you name it do it the drinks are always delicious and the women working the counter are always prepared to offer suggestions and they never up sale they do not work on commission folks everything else you have got dry wines lovely salads beautifully arranged lunch pairings spicy thai pizza duck pizza gelato espresso tiramisu berry lemonadei could go on i will not i think i just heard a lamp breakyou get the point just go already", "its not the best famoso but it is pretty darn good and when you are way out in south common it sure beats the pants off the majority of the places especially if you are looking for a good quick bite with a well priced glass of vino before a movie or in the midst of a shopping blitz the thing i like the best about this location is the island bar i do not think any of the other famosos have an island bar that you can sit up at the servers and all the staff are super friendly even when it is packed the food comes out fast and what ever you order make sure to start with the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella balls they are amazing after that get any za on the menu they all rock", "the order at the counter system is unique but i do not know if it really works with the way this restaurant is laid out it was kind of awkward having to work our way over to the counter to order especially since all the cash registers are on one side which of course was the furthest side from us it almost felt like being at a club and fighting our way to the bar to order a drink plus the waitress kept hanging around our table anyway and asking us if we had questions so it really would not have been much of a stretch for her to take our orders besides the ordering system though i honestly can say i really did enjoy famoso i was expecting something really generic but the pizza was actually really good i ordered the pear gorgonzola at the time it was listed as a seasonal item but it looks like it has been added to their main menu so obviously other people who ordered it enjoyed it as much as i did i like that their menus clearly identify the vegetarian items and that there is plenty of selection for vegetarians and meat eaters alike if you go to famoso on a friday night at dinner time expect to wait in line however it is definitely worth it i can not wait for the new location on whyte ave to open", "food is always amazing coffee is great even black and now with full service its a nice change but the guys bathroom is not pleasant needs cleaning more often better ventilation or something it just needs work", "horrible service ran out of water and never did get a refill the food was not good at all it was very awkward the owner called me and my boyfriend ladies on our way out", "tonight my brother and i tried to eat here we arrived around and we were seated immediately a waitress placed some water on the table we were right next to the servers booth after that not a single employee spoke to us we waited about mins and then left i understand when restaurants are busyand we probably would have waited longer than mins but we did not even meet our server a simple sorry for the wait or ill be right with you would have gone a long way we were only acknowledged when we left with a ok have a nice night", "extremely bland food lasagna tasted like cardboard and thickened milk would never go back very creepy and annoying owner", "it was ok capital as a whole is a lovely restaurant however this location was not up to par the pizza was soggy and greasy i truly enjoyed the service the staff was friendly and on top of everything i never had to wait for water or drinks", "great pizza amazing staff never disappointed with these guys true deep dish pizza and very filling tastes great the next day crust is somehow crispy and soft all at the same time and they have a good cheese meat sauce ratio", "the pizza here is delicious i am a thin crust kind of girl so i am not usually a fan of deep dish pizza but the pizza from cddp is awesome the price point leaves a little to be desired as does the storefront location but the food was great fresh made with tons of cheese", "this place has great pizza it is more pricey than some other pizza take out restaurants but it is a very filling pizza because it has a thick deep dish crust the pizza is also quite heavy and rich because it has a lot of cheese and toppings on it in addition to pizzas they also sell chicken wings salads and pastas but pizza makes up the vast majority of their menu they have a range of pizzas on the menu so you can order what is already there and add extra items if you like there is an extra charge for doing a half and half pizza which is alright because its less costly than ordering two smalls if your pizza tastes differ from who you are dining with downside is that they also do not allow substitutions so if you see a feature pizza you like but want to change out one of the ingredients that is not permitted all in all this is a great pizza shop especially if you are really hungry", "they delivered one night to my house and the next time i asked for delivery they told me they did not deliver to my area worst customer service as well", "this is so stupid so they have their specialty pizzas which all have at least one bad topping on it so i when ordering asked to substitute it for a different topping they informed me that if you substitute a topping you are charged for an additional topping get outta here stop being so greedy and always pushing people for another buck that is the last you will ever hear from me pizza", "previous to boston pizza opened the space was being leased by houstons steak house the airport used to have a sbarros pizza and it was pretty good food for a few years then it changed management and it got pretty gross no one wants rock hard stale pizza or dried up pastas so when bps opened we all knew it would be freshly made and a much better quality of food the only thing about this bps is their prices are slightly higher than other locations pizzas are inch or inch example a medium pizza at the airport location is where everywhere else is usually most staff do not have time to sit down and eat so mostly it is all to go my favorite sandwich there is the brutte genoa salami pepperoni smoked ham onions pizza sauce and melted mozzarella on a french mini baguette the last two times i ordered this sandwich i noticed two things the protein portions got a bit smaller the picture in the menu vs what you get is obvious and twice my side choice caesar salad did not come with the dressing not once twice about for that another favorite is the jambalaya fettuccini now that is a dish where you get a lot for the price highly recommend that sausage shrimp chicken breast cajun spices marinara sauce green onions pan fried with fettuccini pasta comes with garlic toast generally i stay away from their burgers you go to pizza pasta place for that not a burger just because all the other restaurants sell burgers as well overall i would give them a but after the last two orders i dropped it down to a the staff there are always friendly but there are times where you have to get their attention the only thing we hope is the food quality and quantity does not get down graded like some other restaurants at the airport but overall its pretty good food", "three stars as they got my vegan order right second time their staff being in food industry should know the difference between vegan no animal productscheeseeggs vegetarian and gluten free they were confused when i asked a vegetarian pasta to be made vegan and added cheese to it and were not sure if bread counts as vegan id recommend staff to be given this basic training", "came in for a quick take out rushing to a connection staff is friendly food is ok still not using machines for credit cards had to chase down the lady that grabbed my credit card you have to do the signature and manila tip like in the old days", "their pizza is always good here so i recommend that the service is very meh with the waiters paying very little attention to your table after getting your order the food usually comes at reasonable speeds but if you had a complex order its very likely to have something wrong with it every time i order caesars here they make it wrong andor forget to put in the sides also this location is ridiculously cold so bring a sweater or something if you do not want to be chilled", "my experience was excellent i ordered pizza online with a few appetizers the wait on the compute said hrs i understood as the roads were bad and i assumed most people were ordering in my order was piping hot and at my door in mins when does that happen the driver was super pleasant and even cracked a joke i will be ordering online from capilano bps again", "a solid three for my local bps it can be a busy place if there is a oilers game on but we normally sit in the restaurant side not the bar i have been under the weather this last week and once i felt like eating again all i wanted carbs and lots of them i wanted them from somewhere i could go to that did not require me to do my make up or brush my hair bps was there for me as it always is i have tried most off the menu here pizzas pastas salads recently i had the chicken parmigiana with spaghetti and salads it was good plenty of food on the plate and the chicken was very tasty i ordered my daughter a mini pizza but one of the other waitresses took it to another table by mistake so we had to wait a while for them to make another one in the mean time our kid ate half my husbands ham and pineapple pizza so at least she tried some new toppings they took the cost of the kids pizza off the bill so we did not mind the kids colouring book in there is oilers themed which was a great distraction from the missing pizza", "i used to be a die hard boston pizza fan several years ago until they changed their menu and removed all my go to favourites boston pizza can usually be fairly reliable as far as good goes its often just good enough that it will do this location falls in line with being mediocre the service is usually average at best more than once i have had parts of my meal forgotten if you are going to boston pizza you probably know what you are getting yourself into if you are looking for food and service to blow you away keep looking", "so i have been coming here for a while since i moved close to the restaurantpub never had this much bad service in a long time my poutine with my meal was awful i ask for an iced tea and never got it i am aware ems had to come and the manager spoke to them nice to see the poutine was removed due to how crappy it was not sure if id come here again", "this is a solid boston pizza location i have been here a few times with my little family and its pretty baby friendly boston pizza has a pretty standard menu across all of their locations and this one is no exception even when dealing with ridiculous crowds such as on valentines day for heart shaped pizza this location is pretty good", "we came here once during the pandemic adults only to enjoy the patio and the very quiet environment was good the food is standard boston pizza fare which is decent like all similar casual restaurants of this caliber the pandemic menu is somewhat flimsier than it once was but the food is still the standard fare service was good for this patio visit the patio is accessed through the lounge it is nice that this patio is available", "i came here a couple of months ago for my birthday with high hopes after having read great reviews about the place and that they had the most genuine pizza dough around we ordered the marguerita and vesuvio pizzas it was pretty good but did not quite live up to the hype although the dough is better than that of restaurants like pizza hut or even coliseum near rexall place it still does not quite have the same flavour of the dough from pizzerias in the east eg ny or in italy i do not know what it is maybe they undercooked it or they did not let the dough rise for enough time but it tasted a bit like raw pizza dough", "i am not a huge fan of thin crust pizza but they do it right my wife loves this place which makes for a good tasty cheap date night option", "best pizza i have had since new york and better than any i had in italy i am pumped that we have pizza this good locally the crust is amazing thin yet soft nothing worse than dried out crust mmmm", "modern concept pizzeria met my expectations then exceeded them you order from the front then the food is delivered to your table everything was great loved the nutella desert pizza also well known for their wine selection i have only been once but i always think about how much i want to go back again check their website to find incentives such as cinema coupons and dinner on specified nights", "i had been dreaming of a pizza i had on vacation for a very long time i had yet to find anything that matched it until i stepped into this pizza place the pizza and the olives were to die for definitely returning whenever i can", "wow i love the pizza here and the new location at south edmonton common is so nice we had the arugula siciliana and pollo pizzas the atmosphere is great the staff is great and the food is great i can not wait until i go again this has become my favourite restaurant", "really unique pizza place the dough cheese sauce are are truly unique they bake it specifically and the final product is great decent service", "i just got back from having dinner at this place and it was great the best part about this place is that the pizzas literally take minutes to make and they taste delicious the pizza i got was a bit pricey for its size but it tasted absolutely delicious the only reason i am not giving it a five star review is that it sucks for people who are lactose intolerant like me the pizza must have had tons of lactose in it because i had a pretty bad stomachache when i got back home maybe they could have done something about it while they were cooking i should have asked", "day day oct yelp challenge decent thin crust pizza and from a chain needed a bite to eat after some shopping and before going to the airport so south edmonton commons famoso location is perfect nice decor an unusual style of ordering where you fill out your order card and take it to the central cashier for processing you can start up a tab and order additional items as you go then you settle your bill at the end food comes pretty quickly after you order and although its not the best thin crust pizza i have had its totally decent we shared the prosciutto arugula and the bbq chicken yum good ratio of crust to toppings to sauce if a red pizza i would totally get these again but am definitely tempted by the funghi and the vesuvio versions on the menu prices are around for a pizza which feeds one or max two people with smaller appetites", "i have eaten at famoso numerous times and at many different locations i have always thoroughly enjoyed the food the staff and the overall experience there i decided to order some take out from a different location closer to home i was told by someone that it was not the best famoso location but still went ahead and ordered regardless i thought how bad could it be its famoso unfortunately when i got home and opened my pizza up i seen that only half of my pizza had any toppings on it and it was not properly cut through a third of my pizza was almost completely bare with the exception of some marinara smeared over it making it wet enough to eat fortunately enough for me i enjoy famoso enough to continue eating there but next time i will remember what i was told and i will steer away from that location and drive the extra mile to one of the other locations i have posted a picture in my photos on here for you to view on your own accord its the margherita pizza with half of its toppings", "so the last couple of times the girlfriend and i have gone to this place the service has gone down hill we used to love coming here great food good service now i noticed the last couple of times we have gone there the service was not great this time we got there and they asked us if we wanted to have a table that was reserved for a time that was not enough time for us to eat and enjoy our time then we get a table because i am not going to be rushed so then we get our food the pizzas were not cut properly so we had to ask to get them to re cut them which i thought was funny i worked a job cutting pizza all day its not that hard before we even got to eat our pizza people asked us how it was which i did not like too much then i never got a refill on my drink and watched the waiter come by many many times and i need a drink for my meal so then we were done with the pizza plates the waiter still never came by to get me a refill then the second my girlfriend finished he came to take our plates and ask if we want coffee dessert or the bill so we asked for the bill and i had to ask him for a refill not pleased then he came back with the bill and my drink with the debit machine come on do not rush me and be able to look at the bill and figure out that i did not want to give the waiter a good tip so after that i made sure to tie up the table i think this location needs to work on there customer service i hate it when i do not have anything to drink with my meal it really takes away from my experience then you have the nerve to rush me out service makes or breaks a restaurant in most cases", "excellent soup and salad came here for a meal patio is well kept and the service is awesome had liam as our waiter he went above to ale sure that our drinks were always full and we were taken care of soup was hot and comp t was great will return", "the best caramel macchiato i have ever had puts starbucks to shame meat lovers pizza was decent but light on the meat in my opinion but then again that tends to be the style of the pizzas here paired with a tomato bisque soup quite a treat", "we stumbled upon famoso by accident and have gone back over and over again neopolitan pizza done the neopolitan way the crust is pure bliss its crunchy and moist at the same time and full of flavor the pizza choices are diverse the meat eater and the vegetarian will be satisfied and the quality of food is superb its important to note that there are vegan substitutions for cheese and various vegetarian options you seat yourself read a menu go up to the counter to order and in a few minutes pure heaven arrives at your table the service is prompt and friendly and the prices are perfect i have nothing negative to say", "i am sorry but advertising that you trained in naples does not mean that you automatically know how to make the pizza the pizza was flaccid and soggy and throwing the can of tomatoes directly on the pizza does not make it sauce there are great thin crust pizzas here in edmonton this is not one of them", "one of my best friends just returned from a long trip and we were in serious need of some quality catch up time obviously involving wine we both love famoso so it seemed like an obvious choice the south common location has always been my go to as its pretty big and does not seem to get as busy as the whyte ave location we sat on the patio which had pretty good shelter from the wind and ordered we each got a pizzaette and a caesar salad and we split a bottle of prosecco we were helped by different staff throughout the night one who sat us and took our order at the counter another who poured our wine and checked up on us several times and another who bussed our dishes and took our payments the first two were very helpful and pleasant gentleman the woman on the other hand was rather abrasive being two young girls tipsy on wine and having long conversations we do not require a lot of attention but she had a infectiously bad attitude that definitely soured the mood the food itself was pretty good not the best i have had from a famoso but decent i ordered the funghi pizzaette which was delicious but my caesar salad was literally drowning in garlic it was too much my breath still smells horrible it was a pretty average experience luckily we were so focused on catching up that we were not paying too much attention to anything else i definitely have not written off this location although it is not my number one", "i recently went there a couple weeks ago with someone close to me and i owe great appreciation and admiration to the manager on duty for helping conclude a special day with an experience like no other shout out to him the meal tasted so good", "it has been so long since we i have been to famoso but now that we have moved to the southside we thought we should give this one a try the service was fabulous with our server taking special care to add my allergy concerns to everything we ordered in case my partner and i decided to share anything i am allergic to tomatoes which can make pizza places especially tricky dining experiences we ordered the quadro fromaggio all cheese all the time and our favorite spicy thai pizzas and tried the cauliflower dip because it was half price for happy hour the dip was fantastic and thanks to a refresh of crostini bread we were already started to fill up before the pizza arrived but we managed to persevere and devour some delicious pie before calling it quits with tons of leftovers to bring home with us were planning a return trip at the end of the month already and can not wait to meet up with some of our southside friends there soon", "wow when i have heard the word gourmet with famoso i have to say they are not kidding from the moment we walked in we were treated with kindness and friendly people it definitely is a smaller place with a casual feeling and a relaxed ambience the chianti was mild and refreshing and my fianc\u00e9es vodka with pellegrino was delicious the pizzas came fast and they smelled and looked incredible the flavour was enhanced by my chianti or was it the other way around either way my tummy was happy the siciliana was amazing the ingredients tastes so fresh and the dough was pretty out of this world thank you for everything", "yummm i love having pizza here the atmosphere is one of the best for pizza joints in the city good wine plus salad or i love the assorted olives to go with the yummy wine are one of the few things i definitely order each time i stop in margarita mondays the margarita pizza is only bucks and its pretty good my sister and i usually come here on mondays just for that special on the other days i come for the cavoletti pizzetta which is an individual size pizza and a salad very filling for myself the pizza dough is fairly light so it makes you feel great eating it after a nice workout plus it taste terrific the desserts personally i like gelat the salted caramel one is pretty good with their americano coffee if you love the bread they have a very good pizza dessert that can come with bananas and dolce caramel i always have lunch here at least once a month its probably more actually lol love it here", "i remember going to the downtown famoso way back in and thinking they are really on to something with this authentic italian pizza since then famoso has been our go to pizza place we usually visit the one in south edmonton common due to its convenience but we find they are all pretty similar a note about this location it is often busy at the end of the shopping day we have waited up to minutes for a table its also family friendly so do not be surprised if there are kids around between pm our favourite pizzas are the vesuvio with mushrooms just the right amount of heat or the don andreas for something unique its also fun to try the seasonal specials we have had everything from mu shu duck to potatoes as toppings we regularly order the famoso salad its chock full of deliciousness with veggies feta sopressata and chicken their on tap beer selection is limited i am not a fan of either shocktop or peroni but a glass of wine also pairs nicely with pizza finally i appreciate they have come to their senses about offering full table service i never fully understood ordering food at the till and drinks at the table i like that they have streamlined the process we will be back again and again for more delicious pizza straight from the brick oven", "its a treat going to famoso i am such a fan of their thin crust pizza yumm plus the proscuitto wrapped mozza balls get out i mean get in my mouth that is sweet red tomato sauce artisan bread and meat wrapped cheese balls sounds like something out of a fairy tale ham and pineapple pizza with fresh feta yup you read that right try it it will change your life plus keep the sauce from the mozza balls dip the pizza in eat repeat also try the tomato basil soup now that is a warm hug on a cold day if you need it even if you do not its really delicious gelatto is a must always save your food to take home and make sure to get at least one scoop of gelatto mango pineapple for the win smooth fresh and sweet mmmm", "its been a while since we have been here and we actually we were seated at the same table we sat at last time it was busy last night but the wait was just minutes it did not take long to get our food either we had an pizza that was good but could have been hotter the meatballs were good too i was actually surprised by how delicious the tomato soup was i just knew it was going to be that disgusting campbells stuff but i was wrong the tomato soup was thick creamy and had lots of flavor to it overall good stuff here and well return", "food tasted really good fresh there parmesan dip is amazing very helpful friendly staff", "i need to update my review this place has turned full service and i love it every time my sister and i come into this location we are always treated extremely well even if the place is booming busy today our table service was absolutely impressive our male servers were so accommodating friendly and entertaining i loved how one of the servers told us the history of the wine we choose and the wine was better than expected our food came on time looked and taste amazing as always i had the soup and salad my mom had the same and my sister had the new featuring pasta we also ordered a margarita pizza to share wow a lot of food we could barely finish i can not express how much i adore this place the staff is absolutely incredible very attentive and super friendly we will always be a regular here especially at this location", "have been to this place before and if i had rated it then would have given higher stars its been a while so i am not sure when they removed the individual pizza with soup or salad but that my was entire reason for going husband and i never agree on pizza so sharing one sucks but i was not prepared to buy a second full pizza so we went with just cheese we ordered starter caesar salads with prosciutto which were good so were our drinks while covid precautions were being taken there was a staff member that came out with his mask under his nose he was immediately reprimanded but it was in the middle of the restaurant and i feel like were far enough into this pandemic that people should not have to be reminded our table felt kind of sticky but i think its an age thing or maybe a cleaner thing did not look dirty but did not feel awesome under my elbows if that makes sense pizza was okay except for two pieces which tasted like soap i thought i was being crazy but husband also thought the same thing all in all it was not a terrible experience but we will not likely be back did not even bother taking pictures which is unusual", "amazing love it here fresh fast affordable", "famoso is a place i can visit in any occasion lunch supper dinner to catch up with friends for a date or just to enjoy my book while i eat a tasty pasta or pizza this central location welcomes everyone adults and kids families and big groups it is located in the hart of south common really close to the movie theater so almost every time i want to check a movie i know i will have an amazing dinner the service is one of the most important reasons while i keep visiting them they are so nice and make you feel welcome i have ordered pizzetas soups salads but last time i went it was on a sunday after a movie it was almost pm they close at on sunday but the server was happy to let us order we had a half caesar salad it came with romaine lettuce their delicious signature dressing lemon wedge and of course proscuitto crisps i am taking one star off as the proscuitto crisp was a fundamental part of the salad and now you have to pay extra for it the pizza was a primavera smoked mozzarella roasted peppers artichoke roasted mushrooms olives red onions basil", "my boyfriend and i came here on a friday night it was packed but we did not have to wait long for a table i enjoyed the vibrant atmosphere i was surprised by how quickly we received our pizzas i had ordered a thin crust pepperini and mushroom pizza it looked great and it was piping hot unfortunately it tasted bland and it mainly had to do with the sauce overall famoso is okay but a place i will not frequent as much", "this location is our back from a long trip stop for a well deserved late lunch early dinner after travelling the staff is always quite nice and the pizza is always well made", "i have been to this famoso a few times and i went back for a quick lunch the other day i like the casual style of this restaurant you order at the counter and pay and then food and drinks are brought to your table i ordered the tomatoe bisque a delicious warm and creamy soup which is perfect for a winter day normally i like the margherita pizza but i decided to try the pear gorgonzola the pizza is apparently neapolitan style never been to naples but i can say the pizza is s delicious very thin crust slightly charred and the toppings sweet pears with a nice balance of gorgonzola cheese arugula and pine nuts the food comes pretty quickly and the service is fast and friendly they apparently have a movie deal for the cineplex in south common making famoso great for a night out", "this pizza was so bomb remind me of firecrust pizza which went out of business so good the cheese is fire and you can eat half fr leftovers and its still good amazing pizza", "the worst pizza i have ever had soggy and wet with old procutto just foul wings were old and soggy also so disappointed i had to reorder from somewhere else as it was inedible", "ordered from skip the dishes so can not comment on the environment or service but the food was fantastic i will definitely eat the pizza again gluten free crust is the best", "while there are a lot of trendy pizza places in yeg right nowripe tomato might actually be my favorite for neapolitan style pizza i believe they are a franchise but every time i have ordered from here the quality of the food and service has been fantastic my first experience with ripe tomato pizza was when i ordered through uber eats for an amazing bogo deal it is frequent that when i order from uber eats especially with a coupon or deal i do not get the best service it is understandable because food delivery services take a huge portion of the profit from the business please order directly if you can however the staff was very friendly and genuinely happy for my business i had to wait an extra few minutes for the order to be complete and they even gave me a free drink now for the food best pizza i have had in a long time the dough was perfect not soggy and the overall combination of flavors was so good the pizza was even better the next day which is super rare for neapolitan style pizza overall great prices great quality and fantastic service", "had the cheese pizza perfect st timer but will be back grrreat crust and yes the tomato was tasty check it out", "the waitress was very friendly and thoughtful the pizza was good but the lady at the till was extremely nasty she took our bill without saying anything not even asking how it was or how much we owed gave us a change and still said nothing not even a smile", "first time eating here and ordered a large meat lovers pizza we received water right away and the waitress was there in a timely fashion to take our order she was friendly and personable we did have to wait what seemed like an extra long time for the pizza to arrive even though the restaurant did not seem that busy not a big deal but just wanted to note it the pizza arrived fresh hot and was truly delicious has now become my favourite pizza place after being a royal pizza fan i have no idea what the other food items taste like but we both loved the pizza", "this is the best pizza i have had in years really good pizza best crust i love it good service nice family run restaurant", "we went to this local restaurant today for dinner we want it to try it as we always drive by it what a waste of money the place looks old the menus look ok we found the food was not tasteful at all we spend for of us but the food was not worth the price i order fettucini alfredo with chicken it look like soup and salty i could not eat it my children order a hamburger and fries and steak only took one bite each and they were upset my husband order the salmon it look dry and old i mention this to the waitress but she look at me like i was crazy i will never eat there again it was by far the worst waste of money i am so upset", "ordered two medium pizzas for take out on line menu showed and each when i arrived for pickup i was charged when i mentioned the discrepancy i was told that i may have been looking at the website and menu of another capital pizza they are all independently owned and prices may vary when the pizzas were brought out they were in boxes i again mentioned that there was a mistake i ordered mediums these were smalls by the way their menus do not have smalls just medium and large nope i was told that was indeed a medium size i was hungry so i took them and left sofor at capital steak and pizza you get pizzas it was a tasty product but for that price ill have a steak and a glass of wine definitely not worth my repeat business", "expensive and bad food are the best descriptiors i can provide i used to run with groups at the running room next door and saw that this place was always busy i took that as a good sign i was wrong i convinced my wife and kids to try this place with an intent to try something new none of us finished what was on our plates i do not see us ever going back and i do not recommend trying this location the servers were nice enough the food was sub par and way overpriced", "ok so chicago deep dish has been around for years or so i am told by the owner i just discovered this place a few weeks ago i loved this pizza the crust was so thick and tasty and they do not skimp on any toppings it would be nice if they had some tables to sit and eat this place it pick up or delivery only but it still is very tasty i really enjoyed the cheese and mushroom with chilli flacks and the sauce", "everything that could possibly go wrong did we ordered delivery to our hotel extremely rude on the phone the debit machine was broken so we had to pull out cash from the hotel atm specifically asked for the total so we could get the right amount of money when they arrived they tried to charge us over the price given to us on the phone both pizzas were missing a topping and they gave us half of the chicken wings ordered they did nothing to rectify the errors pizzas just tasted ok nothing special and these are not even close to deep dish like a true chicago deep dish pizza", "good pizza very filling and reasonably priced my only complaint is that i was told that it would take minutes i asked if they could call me minutes before it was done and they said they would minutes later they call your pizza is ready i was in a rush so i was really looking for that minute heads up but the pizza was good so stars", "i really wanted to like this place as i have been looking for a new pizza go to but i was a bit underwhelmed delivery was faster than expected the pizza was ok and my order was correct but that is as good as it gets opened the box and the first thing i see is a black hair laying on top of the pizza i ordered hot wings well done they were a soggygreasy mess when they arrived there was barely any hot sauce on them and no flavour just tasted extremely salty ceaser salad was also not worth just a bunch of romaine chopped up with soggy breadcrumbs because they did not dry the lettuce if i order again i will only be getting pizza hopefully minus the hair", "why do i eat here gross why you ask wings were way way over deep fried until they were dry hard way to saucy as well pizza has always been one of the worst of all pizza places when i ordered by phone the man barely spoke english and was quite rude its like i ruined his night because i was trying to buy pizza pizza and i are done", "pizza are all over the city and luckily this one is close by enough for me to pick up costs to deliver plus tip so this saves me at least bucks one of the things i like is they have all sorts of deals pick up or delivery they have deals for everyone a small one topper pizza is a large is pretty reasonable right now add wings all sorts of wings stay away from boneless basically chicken nuggets in other words cheap i personally like the crispy coated or naked plain wings as those have a bit more meat on them on top of that they have wedges curly fries onion rings wedgies pizza dough sprinkled with garlic butter parmesan and seasonings this location has never served me a bad pizza or given me bad service they have always been prompt and courteous whenever i walked in yes i know fast food joints only want to bang out product as fast as they can and make the most money for it pizza at this location is not bad for a few years they had an app but it was only available on iphones but now they have them for android phones which is good their website was a bit of a mess a few years ago as well but that is been cleaned up and much easier to navigate", "i used to like pizza but my most recent order was disgusting and a waste of money the crust was like cardboard and they really skimped on the toppings and cheese even with extra cheese as part of the order the wings were good at least which made up for the terrible pizza i will not be ordering from here again", "there is reason this location has such badd reviews are pizza was raw twice and they refused to refund the meal by son was sick the next day because of it go literally anywhere else but here and you will be happier took over an hour for the pizza to be delivered both times and the delivery driver called times on the original order for directions horrible customer service", "i already send my comments to that address and was told that is too bad and offered a credit which i do not want a refund should be issued", "i read some of the reviews and it seemed like just the people who had a bad experience writing so i felt i should share my good experience i used the pizza app to order and pay and that was pretty slick i ordered two medium pizzas with thin crust and they were ready when i arrived to pick them up they were really good pizzas the crust was crunchy just the way we like them the location is just down the street from us so well be trying them again i will also try some of their wings next time looking forward to it already", "best pizza in sherwood park i have been going to nitzas since high school when they offered all you can eat pizza for like i do not know if they offer that anymore but either way i get delivery now as that was eat in only my favorite pizzas from nitzas are the donair with just meat and sauce and one with pepperoni mushroom and crumbled bacon however i recently went off book and tried the donair but also added hot pepperoni and black olives it blew my mind i loved how the salty olives and sweet donair sauce complimented the spicy pepperoni i can not wait to try it again the delivery hits my house in well under an hour every time and the pizza is always hot and fresh", "always amazing food quick and super friendly service plus they have always been fantastic when dealing with a a volunteer group i would highly recommend", "i love this place i am a donair pizza fanatic and they make the best donair pizza in the edmonton area i am going to the extra onions and mushrooms you can get and oodles of sauce takes it to the next level i live in edmonton and drive out to sherwood park just to get their donair pizza on occasion my husband loves their tropical pig pizza the service is always quick the prices reasonable and did i mention that i love their donair pizza we have browsed their menu while waiting and they definitely have some unique pizza toppings that i am sure are also great ill stick to my donair pizza forever though", "this is the best pizza in sherwood park way better than the new nitzas the crusts here are fresh and delicious the sauce is great and the toppings are all fresh and delicious as well the staff is very friendly on multiple occasions while we were waiting for our pizzas they offered us a can of pop usually for our wait if you are buying order from the for menu the pizzas are considerably cheaper or so more for mediums vs large they recently moved from their old location to the old happy mart if you are looking for them defiantly recommended", "this is one of my favourite places to get pizza and always will be i used to work here as well a few years ago which some may think causes a bias but i think it makes for an even more honest review because i know how things are prepared from start to finish first things first the dough is freshly prepared everyday by a wonderful gentleman we all call sunny because he has a shinning personality and a smile on his face ready to help all customers that come in the door but back to the dough wow it smells and tastes phenomenal and like i said its freshly prepared every day there is so many different options for toppings and its truly wonderful because you can endlessly create pizzas and get a great deal i also had the opportunity to experience how omar the owner treated his customers he knew peoples names asked about their kids how their specific job or business was going because he genuinely cared about how his customers were doing he also goes above and beyond for everyone who walks in even if its something small like offering them some pop or giving them another pizza on the house the man is a good guy and also was an excellent boss and continues still to be kind to me even thought i have not worked for him for years if you are looking for a pizza that is delicious and reasonably priced look no further and visit some of my favourite people at nitzas", "yes the reviews are correct they have good pizza and full of toppings lots of green peppers lots of mushrooms good amount of cheese it was so much better than the panago we ordered a week earlier this will be our new regular goto for pizza two thumbs up they also have a tv to watch sports while you wait for your order", "decent pizza take out place i have only ordered from here a couple of times but i am glad i decided to get a delivery from them last week easy enough to place an order online the delivery driver was lovely and rang the bell and stepped back far enough to make sure someone picked up the pizza awesome technique and well appreciated with this social distancing one really craves carbs after all decent crust thickness and good amount of toppings i ordered a caesar salad not knowing it would be so big that it would be three meal potions sauce on that side and toast cane with it bit disappointed that the bacon on yet salad was the fake bacon bits but it was still good to have some greens got my milk intake too definitely a nice local pizza place to grab take out or get delivery", "this place is awesome donair pizza is delicious super friendly staff kids can sometimes go back and make their own pizzas", "i love the free kids tours what a fantastic way to get kids involved and knowing where there food comes from the fact that all donations from the kids pizzas go to the stollery is amazing little more sauce onions on the donair and it would have been stars", "i normally order from nitzas when its pizza night we enjoy the freshness and the taste of pretty much all of their pizzas yes we have tried most of them our favorite is the cheese we do not care for the tomatoes so we order without normally the tomatoes get soggy by the time they are delivered the donair pizza is awesome too tried the lasagna based on suggestions from friends not for us but hey its okay", "my husband myself and my son were all in your restaurant a little over two hours ago probably around pm it was our first time eating in and i just wanted to say how nice it was to first enter and see a group of young adults i will not say teenagers due to the awesome behavior behind the counter who were all attentive and did not have cell phones in their hands and truly provided great awesome customer service there was this one young lady who was working longer dark hair and dark framed glasses and my goodness she went above and beyond her job our son who is almost she offered him a slushy as soon as he entered and then he began to have a melt down due to just waking up from a nap she tried to joke with him and got the table all set up for us while we waited for our food the meltdown was continuing as my husband tried to carry him around to calm him down as we waited for our food once our pizza arrived and it was too warm for my son she just walked over to our table and took his pizza and said that she would place it in the freezer so it could cool down enough for him to eat the amount of common sense in this young ladys head is amazing i thanked her as at this point the meltdown was going on for about minutes and i just wanted to pull my own hair out and crawl into a hole then once my son continued to have his meltdown i decided that we would leave i went to the counter and asked for boxes to put our pizza in and this young girl ran over and helped me pack up all of our food then ran to answer the phone i told her on my way out that she is an amazing young person and really amazing at her job had my son not been flipping out we were going to wait and ask to speak to the manager to tell him about the amazing customer service this young lady provided us with she truly is a great young lady and an asset to your business", "i have to say the staff when i went in to get my pizzas were great and friendly i guess that was to help cover up for the bad pizzas we had people sitting home waiting to enjoy this so called great pizza and everyone was extremely disappointed we paid just short of for two large pizzas that were about the size of a couple of and figured that this was not going to be enough to feed us all to our surprise we pretty much had one whole pizza left because no one liked either one our donair pizza tasted like it had mayonnaise on it instead of donair sauce and who puts red sauce on the donair pizza the other meat pizza was just plain bad tasting as well pretty bad when our pizza eating dog would not eat either one as well needless to say i will not be throwing another dollars to the composte bin again from this place", "i dislike making phone calls to secure meals i find more mistakes are made this way then through web based order systems unfortunately nitzas on wye does not offer online ordering fortunately they have never mistaken our order the usually women who answer the phone do so promptly and repeat my order back to me along with the delivery info they could stand to speak a little clearer and slower but i understand they are pretty busy handling both phone and counter orders delivery estimates can seem a little long between and minutes but the pizzas arrive within that time frame and they are always hot i have had several of their veggie selections including the veghead with and without cheese and the greek popeye on the latter i have swapped out the fresh tomatoes i find them abhorrent on pizza for banana peppers and sundried tomatoes with no issues though there seems to be some confusion about whether substitutions are allowed so far no one has vetoed my choices if they ever do ill stop ordering here as a vegetarian i am usually have so few options for recipe pizzas mushrooms on every one i feel i am being taxed when i create my own variations their sauce is excellent not too sweet not too stingy the ingredients are generous and fresh a little too generous when it comes to the artichokes i like the chokes strained a bit more thoroughly or they make my pizza soggy i can not speak to the meat recipes but my partner loves the chicken ranch he ordered the vegetarian nightmare once and said it was kind of boring today our pizzas arrived in minutes", "love this place costumer service at its finest plus they cater to kids on top of all that the food is awesome", "use to love there food most resent couple of times the donair meat was not cocked right my family and i got sick onion rings came soggy as soup not to mention when ordering for delivery just hope you do not have to repeat what you want times or more highly not impressed", "honestly when this pizza joint first opened about years ago i hated it but then i ordered from there yesterday and omg i do not know what they have done but it was fabulous everything was so freshhotmouth watering they must have tweaked the recipe because the pizza was so flavorful the donair sauce was on point too hands down the best pizza in sherwood park a bit pricey but you get what you pay forquality i am definitely now a returning customer", "the best thanks for feeding my friends family and coworkers for the past year and now at my new location nwr i know its a distance but we loved our christmas pizza lunch at work not a slice left thanks again peter rene and the rest of your staff until the new year i can not wait", "excellent pizza exceptional service can not say enough good things about nitzas they do truly understand customer service and excellent food service is above and beyond and the food is all quality delicious and prepared with care", "great pizzaamazing tastegreat choices on menuboth vege and non vege itemshad their pizza at a partywill definately try the resturantrecommended", "excellent food and service we were at this location on february with a group they were excellent to deal with we let them know what time we would be arriving and everything was ready to go when we got there we were served a good variety of pizza salad fries wings and fountain soft drinks they set the food up buffet style for us we were really impressed with the quality quantity and variety of food the service was exceptional as well this will be our new go to individually or as a group it was one of the best food and service experiences we have ever had great value as well thank you nitzas", "pizza not the same anymore ordered pepperoni but meat seems not want we want not so great valentines meal on the other hand fast service and clean eating area", "so delicious every time we usually get the donair pizza you can not go wrong", "love love love this place greek salad the best i order it every time pizza is delicious crust is not thick pizza itself is not greasy our kids love the chicken tenders and fries two kids even two adults could easily split the portion it is huge they always offer free fountain drinks whenever we pick up another plus the other night my husband went in to pick up with our son who was in his soccer attire the owner was there and he said that if our son only let in two goals next game he would get a free pizza it does not get any better than that made our sons day this will continue to be our go to take out place we have eaten in before very casual set up for those who are wondering and it was great too the prices might be slightly high but the quality is there so who am i to complain", "love this place peter and the gang are awesome love the new additions to the menu", "i have eaten here twice in the past couple of months and loved it both times the location is reasonably spacious and quite comfortable if you want to eat in and take out on a saturday night was ready in under minutes i am not a huge pizza fan but their pizzas are delicious the crusts are doughy but not too thick and i did not find the pizza greasy at all they have a wide variety of pizzas on their menu and offer free fountain pop or slushies with your purchase the staff were friendly and i can not wait to go back highly recommended", "this pizza place used to be the best pizza place in sherwood park but recently the prices have been going up and the quality has been going down i would now recommend the old nitzas pizza over the new one i would no longer recommend this pizza restaurant to people unfortunately", "wow this is the best pizza in sherwood park the atmosphere is nice and modern they have free pop with your pizza and the pizza comes fast and tastes delicious", "awesome pizza great staff delivery is fast and they delivery to acreages in ardrossan", "so i can not believe i have never heard of this place before i asked on facebook where would be a good place to take my daughter for lunch who is developmentally delayed someone mentioned that nitza pizza on sundays allow kids to make their own pizzas if you just donate to the stollery we were warmly greeted by the staff and they treated my daughter well she made her own little pizza while my husband ordered a large un vegetarian and i ordered a larger conners delight the pizza came out promptly and it was delicious nice thin crust good sauce and lots of toppings and such a great restaurant to support they do so much for the stollery in memory of their niece nitza who used it they also give you a good bang for your buck with their two for ones and a free pop or slushie with your order", "recently tried nitzasgluten free of coursethe pizza was delish light crust plenty of toppings and the sauce was just right be prepared for a wait they make it all fresh will be back and recommend", "i can start by saying i prefer this establishments pizza over boston pizza because it does not have that sweet taste in the sauce that bp has i rate them a because of their total disregard for customer care me and my wife both work leaving us with a limited window in our day to do what we need togroceries household maintenance etc they usually have a minute wait time so we called minutes ahead of time right after work my wife spoke with one of the girls and asked her for the total she stated around my wife asked for an exact amount so we could be sure that we would be taking everything we ordered who wants a surprise pizza bill after all so she said yeah its going to be even so as were pulling up we get a call the guy says that he was just confirming the phone number was real need i remind you that the time for the order was minutes same amount of time it takes us to get there we told the guy we were pulling up and it should have been done already when were inside the guy from the phone said that its an out of town number and they wanted to make sure that it was not someone from elsewhere trying to contact someone else we then had to wait about minutes there and when it came out the cashier told us the total was i told her that we were told she said well i did not take your order and i asked for a manager as she was doing that the girl that took the call said to the guy i messed up and ran in the back guy approaches us immediately is defensive says to let him try and figure out a way to lower the price and says there is no way they do not have a regular system that you normally see they have little girls using pen and paper to add it all up i told him that we were told something else and he says ill go ahead and give it to you for just give me its not worth making a girl cry over it was not as easy as i just made it out to be either because i had to put up with his bs negotiation tactics for mins right as i was about to walk out without the pizza before he agreed to accept what one of his employees quoted us had she done her job and added up our total upon request this could have been avoided and to try and make us feel guilty for a girl crying because she did not perform her baasssic duties that i did not even say a word to is completely out of hand in my opinion your employee that messed up is more important to you than a customerwho is paying you how is this customer service why is some little girl in skimpy clothes more important to you than someone who wants your product very very very poor customer service we will not ever be here again sadly there is absolutely no customer loyalty or appreciation", "decent pizza but not worthy of a special trip both pizzas we ordered were wrong or incomplete we ordered it was supposed to have pepperoni and smokey bacon on it it had only one sweet sausage like meat we also had which i really liked but it was missing the tomatoes we advised the store and they were disinterested the sizes are smaller than expected think individual when you see medium however i thought the amount of toppings was generous the sauce is quite good free pop or slush provided with order if i lived in the immediate vicinity i would order from here but i would not make a special trip again if i was hungry and passing by i would", "ate here for first time today ordered regular donair wow it was fresh and delicious had to order another one place was clean and tidy friendly counter service order came promptly free parking i could not believe that free fountain pop is offered even if you are not ordering food will be back again", "best pizza place ever i am not a pizza fan and my kids will not eat the crust on most pizzas but this place is different i love their pizzas and my kids do to and always clean their plates not to mention that their donair loaf is amazingly delicious the staff is always friendly and extremely welcoming and accommodating to everyone especially kids i would not order pizza from anywhere else", "chicken taco pizza grilled chicken salsa sauce mushrooms hot peppers cheddar diced fresh tomatoes nitzas pizza if you try the chicken by itself its duller than an episode of little house on the prairie but lost in that sea of banana peppers and salsa you will not notice the chickens plainness the other ingredients especially the infernal salsa help carry it to a culinary victory i am certain ground beef would have tasted better but i thoroughly enjoyed this chicken tacopizza amalgam a masochistic pleasure that catered to my insatiable desire for hot foods my rating the other half of the pizza your left side is some artichoke concoction for my wife i did not care to try it facebookcomramneeksfoodreviews", "great pizza but what is even better is the customer service the owner takes time to visit with the customers especially my children they do countless sponsors for the community and gave our hockey team a great party for only ten bucks a person all you can eat pizza and wings they even go as far to allow kids to make there own pizza which they can not get enough of great food great prices and great customer service", "great restaurant good prices donairs are delicious salads are always fresh and tasty although twice my greek salad was a little over saturated with dressing pizza is fantastic staff always very friendly although we had a coupon for free pizza but when we tried to order two pizzas one with the coupon and one without we were told the free pizza had to be picked up but they would deliver the nd pizza we ended up having to pay for pizzas in order to have them both delivered it was strange", "nitzas pizza will definitely go down as one of albertas finest i can see it growing into a larger franchise ever since i was a kid i am not that old even when there was just the one location this was my familys go to pizza a truly unique recipe the perfect amount of sauce meats cheeses and vegetables for the strange ones who eat vegetables i have grown up eating nitzas pizza and i can see myself eating it in a seniors home at one point of my life i highly recommend the food here for anyone looking for a new place to try that will satisfy their taste buds i recently moved minute from the wye road location which has had negative effects on my weight however the staff there are very pleasant enjoy", "love this local small business they make some awesome pizzas and take care in crafting unique options always tasty decently fast in making it for takeout they even offer free pop or slushie while you wait for your order this is gold while its a small thing the small things in life are sometimes the best bonus they made the wrong pizza when prepping my order so they included as a free pizza with my correct order its awesome because it makes one super happy customer can not say no to free pizza and it helps save on food waste cheers will be a life time customer", "i went here to pick up pizza last night and witnessed the owner yelling at his employees and berating them i asked him if he was always so unhappy and he said he was fine but his employees were not able to follow his instructions so he had to get angry with them i suggested he speak to them privately instead of yelling in front of so many customers and he told me to mind my own business the young ladies working on the counter said he is always like that and they have figured out techniques to stay out of the line of fire and diffuse him i told her there are other jobs out there and they did not have to put up with that crap i will never go back", "i do not normally write reviews but after phoning in with a complaint being accused of being dishonest my daughter being accused of being dishonest i felt i need to caution others after being a long time customer since they opened in sherwood park before in st albert i could not accept the treatment my daughter received when i phoned in to complain the treatment i received was just as rude angry i can guarantee if i had walked in he would not have spoken to me in that manner so here is the deal a couple of months ago we bought some coupons through a hockey fundraiser for nitza pizza good because support a local business one we love glad that this business was supporting the community this is not the first time we have bought these coupons we also know many in the community who buy them as well we know how it works we know you can not use them fridays which is why last friday when all my kids were home we ordered three paid for them and we know one coupon at a time so we usually order an extra however tonight my daughter i were home alone i was stuck at work so i phoned her to put some supper on she asked if we could get a pizza from nitzas i said fine but how you going to pick it up she does not drive yet she said her friend was over that is what her family was doing for supper because they were both going to their perspective homes they did not think both of them having a coupon would be an issue perfect i also told my daughter if she wanted milk she would have to pick up a jug at macs as we were out i mean really pizza without milk you got to have milk the girls phoned in their orders would go pick up their perspective pizzas then her friend would drop her back off on her way homethey live just north of us so this made sense the problem arises when they went to pick up they found parking at the end of the lot as there was no spots open when they parked my daughter ran to macs and her friend went and grab her pizza my daughter went to get our pizza and the girl asked how she was going to pay and she gave her the coupon the owner started yelling at her saying are you with the other girl you can not use that he continued to yell tell her she was dishonest everyone was staring at her she said she felt like she had been caught stealing or somethingshe said he continued to swear and tell her she was f ing lying and that she was going to pay for that pizza she tried to explain and all she got out was umm by this time she was embarrassed and just wanted to leave so she said fine i can pay and he yelled at her that he did not want her money and then walked away telling the girl at the cash to make sure she paid he accused them of parking down the way so they could hide and when i phoned in he was saying there were three spots right in front which my daughter said vacated after they had parked when i got home after work i found my daughter crying and very upset when i inquired why she explained what took place so when i phoned in to complain about his assumption rudeness foul behaviour towards my daughter he continued to talk over me when i asked him to let me explain why the girls were togetherhe started telling me how i was dishonest that my daughter was a liar i asked him to please listen to what i had to tell him i had not had a chance to explain he just kept asking if i was done yet would not listen so sir yes i am so done i have been in the customer services business for i have seen it all so i understand your distrust however had you actually calmly asked if they were together she would have explained for lack of better term they were ride sharing and no they were not eating supper together i even offered him the other families phone number to follow up he did not want no number he saw two young girls and jumped to an assumption and a conclusion which were totally wrong he also told me i did not pay for that pizza so he is losing money well first we did pay for our pizza and my daughter brought home a coupon which we also paid for of which goes to the fundraiser so i think for a cheese pizza he did not lose money he has lost a long time customer who actually promoted his business which now all stops we teach our children to not bully in school i will be damned if i let a business be a bully shame on you sir for how you behaved you may be helping the community but you are setting a poor example of how to be a human being if it had been me in your shoes i would have calmly asked the questions are you together did you know the rules of the coupon they would have been given an opportunity answer which i know did not happen because of how you spoke to me on the phone once they explained their position i probably would have given them the benefit of the doubt told them that they could not do that next time because of untrustworthy customers", "this is just not my favourite pizza which considering it is the rest of my familys favourite pizza makes me feel like there is something wrong with me i love that the staff are always so friendly and that you get a free slushie with your order i am just never thrilled with my pizza is it fine absolutely would i rather eat pizza from nearly anywhere else also yes that being said the donair pizza was always something my family raved about", "great food and great staff wish they had a bigger location as it can get busy but worth the wait if you have to", "the poor rating is for treatment of the staff with first hand experience i can tell you we had to fight with peter for our daughter to be compensated for the shifts she worked he wanted to dock her two shifts to pay for the nitzas t shirt his wife was pleading for him to pay she was clearly uncomfortable trying to bridge our expectations and her husbands refusal our persistence paid off eventually his use of profanity directed at these kids is unacceptable being a customer previously i had only seen a wonderful side of peter kind happy and engaging be warned as we know our experience is not isolated", "attentive server parking was easy its a pretty large bps overall i had a good time here", "came with my year in old in time for the kidscard event for a donation you get a card with free kids meals on it kids meals are usually so its a great deal you just have to purchase one regular meal each time we had tasty pizza cheese for him and spinach feta shrimp in mine friendly server and very clean and quiet room oddly hip alternative music though i find bp a good standard for families with young kids can not go wrong with the kids card works out to a dollar per meal and they are valid till june", "have you ever been out to eat and were shocked that the place you ended up choosing was an actual restaurant that is the vibe when you eat at this boston pizza i used to eat at bps times a week years ago even then i thought it was mediocre this today was just completely unacceptable as an eating establishment long story shortthere was lots of food on the floor right at our table pizza chips big enough bits that we could tell what the last customers ordered three people served us at our table and not one noticed the revolting mess on the floor at out table we finally called for the manager who apologized gave some kind of excuse that i did not even really understand it was not the servers job or something they only focus on tables and she cleaned it up and comped an order of calamari for us now the calamari was an add on we ordered because our food was horrible i do not use that word lightly salmon so dry i nearly choked getting it down rubbery tasteless frozen bagged veggies badly cooked mediterranean salad that was mostly leaves and very tiny bits of other barely identifiable things they used to have a chunky med salad with big chunks of feta tomato cucumbers and onions not any more horrible meal the only saving grace was that the manager was receptive to our concerns", "way to go bps argyll you have redeemed yourself our server was attentive and remember everything about what we wanted she was friendly and enjoyed being here on a saturday afternoon my fianc\u00e9e tried the gluten free pizza and loved it i know it is a company wide recipe but they did a great job here", "we decided to watch the ufc fights at the last minute this weekend i only wanted to see the ortizgriffin fight the rest of the fight card did not interest me at they start at we decided to go for all of them and ended up at the closest place to us at the time boston pizza i was immediately peeved after we walked in we paid the cover charge and then walked up to a booth only to find that we were not allowed to sit there because there were only of us we paid to be there let us sit where we want they were not even busy our server was good about refilling our drinks but seemed very unhappy and annoyed every time she did the only reason i am not giving them star is because their chocolate brownie addiction was yummy i was not impressed by the night or the fights i will not be going back to this boston pizza for food or fights", "service is terrible the people here do not even care to check on customer questions super lazy crew that are more worried about the kitchen gossip and snap then the customer experience they gave me a big pizza when i ordered a small pizza they also screwed up my salad order lol go to the local family spot next door support local mom and pop shops if you can besides its way better food this place has that big chain taste", "seems like a pretty standard boston pizza location i was a bit surprised that the staff member serving our group never refilled my water glass but i guess he did come around and asked if people needed glasses refilled but mine was not empty then the food is pretty standard for a boston pizza location the location is a bit of a walk from transit but there is ample parking", "boston pizza is okay nothing special about it but its decent i do not usually come here too often as it is pricey and the portions are not big enough for how much you pay but on nights when i do not feel like cooking and i do not want to go out ill order bps delivery because there are more selections than just pizza", "the drinks were cold and the beers were nice and crisp but our server zachary gave us the weirdest vibe ever he was odd and made all of us feel uncomfortable i would not recommend this location to anyone", "we people ordered pork rib bites for appetizer boston royal pizza individual size and ny steak and veggie at first but the portion was small and i had to add another main dish marinara linguini we finished off with chocolate explosion which was big and very tasty overall the appetizer and the desert are very good but the three main dishes are little below average the royal pizza has a lot of ingredients but they do not mix well cook a bit longer may help the steak is a little salty and hard", "service was speedy and polite i also appreciated the new renovations a lighter coat of paint and some grayscale photos really brightened up the interior and gave the bps a more modern feel my wings and bandera bread were cooked great and arrived promptly our waitress was friendly but not so attentive as to interrupt conversation with questions every couple of minutes great job", "mmmm pizza i heard from a few friends this was a restaurant with great pizza we stopped in around pm on a monday to check out the half price pizza its located in a strip mall beside a child care facility and near the eleven there is not a lot of parking but for the time we went there were a few spots inside the restaurant only had a few tables occupied it had a different vibe it was not totally dark but not bright for a restaurant with the bottles high up in the bar area and the darkness it gave it a bar feel but a family restaurant on both sides were booths and the middle area were tables and chairs we sat at a booth on the left where there was some light coming in from the windows even with the shades pulled low the server brought us menus and i asked about the half price pizza any pizza is half price as long as something else is ordered could be a pop or other food item there was a selection of appetizers salads few pastas entrees but the pizza menu had the most variety we ordered the jalape\u00f1o sticks but my husband ate most of them as i can not handle spicy food they were not too spicy but i did not like the gooey cream cheese filling and the ranch dipping sauce would have been sufficient the wait was longer than i thought with one other person waiting for his food but it was worth it the large with pieces was cooked so not all greasy on the bottom but a nice thick crust and ample toppings with the cheese baked brown on top the special had shrimp onions green peppers mushroom ham and pepperoni it was gooood we both had pieces and the server was great to bring boxes and had the rest boxed up i found the large was enough to eat for meals i even froze a few pieces and reheated it the next day and it still tasted yummy will definitely be back to try another one of their pizzas on a monday for half price pasta tuesday and there is also wine wednesday the server was great and checked on us as needed and gave us a menu on the way out as they deliver for but the specials are only for dine in although they have delivery specials too", "way over rated and very expensive for a topping small pizzathey do not have salami so i was not impressednot a lot of cheese on itcrust is too thicki can get the same pizza at roadrunner pizza for and it is far better", "every meal we have ever ordered is always delicious best delivery pizza in town the delivery person is always nice and friendly", "i like pizza we are from out of town decided to try montys after reading reviews its a fancy pizza place the decor is nice handle on the front door is broken prices are expected and pizza was good we ordered a hawaiian for the kids and a large chicken alfredo the toppings were thick and cheese was delicious to split it was a sunday night and the restaurant was very empty at one point it was only us there was one nice waitress watching the place by herself i am not sure if this is the normal here on a busier night she was hostess waitress and bar tending she did her best but it was obvious she lacked bartending skills as she asked me if my shirley temple was a virgin she was a nervous server but did the job as expect ok service stars for service and food plus one for the fancy decor", "i love montys their sandwiches and salads are just ok in my opinion but their pizza is amazing they do a great job at delivery as well we were at a friends house and ordered pizza salads and steak for delivery i was worried about getting steak delivered but it was done just right the only reason i gave them starts not is that i wish they would add some more choices to the menu specially in the sandwich or a light meal department", "montys pizza was really good the pizza was filled with all the toppings you could tell they did not hold back the crust was perfectly cooked we will be getting pizza from here again", "this is not your standard pizza cheese cheese and more cheese these pizzas are loaded and heavy this neighbourhood pizza place is a gem it is well kept the staff are fantastic for both dine in and delivery if you are looking for a pizza with flavour and great ingredients and amazing quality try this out you will not be disappointed", "we moved to the glastonbury neighborhood about two and a half years ago and since then this is our go to for pizza i am a plain cheese pizza fan and holy moly the amount of cheese they put on is legendary the crust is also this crispy masterpiece that occasionally seems cheesy also and its amazing we rarely venture outside of pizza but i have tried the donair and bacon cheeseburger and those are solid also the burger reminds me a lot of the burger baron ones we usually pick up so i can not speak much of the actual restaurant the one time we tried to eat in our toddler decided that was the perfect time for a meltdown and we had to leave the waitress was totally understanding and boxed up our order to go all in all this place has never disappointed us", "here is some advice hire some servers who know what they are doing i have been sitting here for mins waiting on my meal and have watched not but tables walk out there is no order to what they are doing they do not smile and one is dressed like a hobo they do not greet guests as they walk in and they do not reassure guests that they are aware of their presence the table next to us has not gotten drinks and they have been sitting for plus minutes why would you have only servers working i see people waiting for their food to be boxed people waiting for refills people waiting for menus people waiting for a long time in general for everything as a server i just want to scream at these girls get your shit together but that is up to the owner this was a sadly run restaurant in the future ill stick to ordering to go as the pizza is still good even if the service is the worst", "ordered large deluxe for delivery man on the phone was pleasant and we order was placed quickly delivery person has prompt and friendly pizza itself was not huge but man it was thick and and loaded if you want to gorge on pieces of non filling pizza this is not for you very filling each piece is a meal will likely order again", "we ordered pizza for delivery not knowing anything about montys just that they were close to our hotel we were super impressed cheesy meaty goodness quick delivery i would definitely order from there next time we are in edmonton", "even though the pizza is excellent and i do recommend the spicy sauce the fish and chips were very greasy everything else i have tried is excellent delivery is good not excellent just good", "delicious hearty pizza we got two extra larges half greek half donair half meat half montys all were scrumptious esp enjoyed the greek pricey though for two pizzas", "i usually order pizza to go from here the pizza is old school cheese on top and is delicious the mozzarella cheese is very high quality and the crust has a nice sweet and just crunchy enough tastetexture lots of high quality toppings best pizza i have had in edmonton they have pastapizza specials to eat in store mondays and tuesdays on their website staff is friendly a few big screen tvs above the bar to watch while i waited", "one of the best pizzas in edmonton all of the food on the menu is good especially the dry ribs service is always good a little gem", "ordered pizza to go on a monday night when they are off for eat in or pick up we ordered a large house special took a little longer than promised but was worth it nice crust not deep dish but substantial lots of toppings and cheese so few pizzas come with shrimp any more nice to have that as part of the special not the cheapest pizza around but a good tasty pizza with quality toppings because its got lots of substance we did get a couple good meals out of it", "montys pizza was good l rate this place four stars the pizza was hot and just the right amount of cheese yum", "great little pizza joint in the west part of edmonton service alone would be stars the pizza is good not amazing but good the portions are spot on and everything was hot only missing a star because it was a little dirty and the bathroom was not very clean at all however this would not stop us from going again", "this is my favorite place to order from so many choices pizza is delicious and the burgers are amazing delivery is always fast and warm with great service i recommend this place to everyone", "best pizza in the west edmonton area hands down always consistently good best pizza is the donair pizzammmm they deliver or do pick up i have never dined inhowever they recently underwent renovations have not seen it yet side note avoid the greek salad disappointingjust a lot of tomatoesnot like a normal greek salad and the dressing is yucky all their pizza is awesome though", "montys pizza would be a reason to not only visit but perhaps even move to edmonton you know how when you are wasted and its late and you just pick up a piece to demolish a bit of it but then can not stop because the crust is the best part its that close your eyes and dream about how pizza hut might be if it was prepared by people who obviously cared that is montys get some delivery was slow but worth every second", "loved the place so badly very clean and organized as for the food it was mouthwatering very friendly staff owner and they take good care of the customers highly recommended", "house special yelps slightly over cooked wait time min minus yelp i am sure i can find pizza in less than min", "advertises as edmontons best pizza do not know if that is true but if you like a thick pizza i recommend this place i had the house special and it was delicious would definitely go back", "loved the food great service and really fast to get to eating after we ordered i will for sure go again and again the place is nice and clean inside as well", "this are not dominos i mean that in a good way montys is more of an upscale pizza restaurant then your average take out joint according to them they were voted pizza in edmonton i am not sure by whom they were not really forthcoming with that information i ordered the large meat lovers which comes stuffed with ham bacon pepperoni italian sausage and beef they make their pizzas so that the toppings are under the cheese as opposed to on top if you are a topping nibbler you might be slightly underwhelmed question are they really toppings if they are underneath the cheese the pizza was very good and worth the to minute wait i started off with the jalape\u00f1o sticks which were slightly disappointing they come mixed with cream cheese which highly dilutes the spiciness of the jalape\u00f1os the decor of montys looks like that of a dance clubdark and yuppity they blast hot fm though the sound system which further contributes to the dance club environment kind of a weird atmosphere for a neighbourhood restaurant they also have big screen tvs tuned to tsn or espn the bathrooms are small and kind of danky on the day i was there they did not have any paper towel to dry my hands with and the bathroom is not equipped with a hot air dryer despite the long wait and the dungeon like bathroom i will return to montys mondays is half price pizza day and tuesdays are half price pasta both dine in only both great enticements to come back", "well its as good as they say we had delivery of pizza salad fries chicken fingers all were very tasty", "we stayed in edmonton for the weekend from out of town and ordered pizza from montys not knowing what to expect it exceeded our expectations very friendly customer service when calling very friendly pizza delivery pizza was absolutely amazing full of toppings and flavor was delicious definitely would recommend this place and will be ordering again next time we visit edmonton", "the pizza house special was very very good the pizza took a while longer than normal to make and its a bit pricier than some places but apparently you get what you pay for i am definitely going back the waitresses were excellent and the food above anticipated i highly advise this little gem", "random find that we tried on a whim there is a sign on the door that says there are no specials during renovations of their kitchen but once inside we could not see any renovations in the open looks kind of like a lounge with dark walls and decor with a large bar along the wall service was friendly but a bit slow even though we were one of three tables lots of people stopping in for pick up orders though we went with the buffalo shrimp salad and it may be my new favourite salad in town huge breaded shrimp tossed in hot sauce and a salad with jicama beans corn tortilla stripsso much going on loved it and thought the price was awesome at would easily be pushing at other restaurants also tried the donair pizza and was pretty happy with it felt small for the price for a medium but the crust was good and the toppings were plentiful would definitely come back for the salad and to try a different pizza", "delicious pizza we ordered the deluxe well made but could have used a bit more sauce also ordered the lasagna had lots of cheese but had very little sauce ate pretty dry although still tasty pizza is pretty similar to royal pizzas just a bit more expensive i would recommend getting a side of bolognase when ordering lasagna and extra sauce for the pizza as well", "some of the best thick crust pizza you can find in town absolutely delicious highly recommend the meat or cheese lovers pizza", "i had a craving for some take out but was not to sure what i wanted i looked under places that deliver on yelp and montys came up i have had there pizza before and it was some of the best pizza i have ever had so i thought i try the lasagna since pastas were today i must say it did not disappoint i got the large and it was huge i was only able to eat a third of it and it had tons of meat sauce and that yummy thick layer of baked cheese on top it also came with garlic toast i also got the greek salad that came with lots of feta cheese if i had to criticize something it would be that the tomatoes in the salad did not taste very fresh but all in all amazing i can not wait to try the donair next", "this is our second time we are in and tonight we had it delivered exceptional pizza and the wings were awesome not greasy just cooked perfectly we had to call them and tell them how much we enjoyed delivery man was so nice to awesome pizza we will order again", "great pizza they have the best crust and sauce but never enough sauce even when you beg for extra on seperate occasions really disappointing cuz its my favorite part if i wanted cheese bread i would just order that", "my review starts with the basic ingredient bread in my opinion things that are mostly bread should not cost more than a loaf of the gluten itself while i close the port in which the transaction of money and bread is finalized i think about my parents telling me in my youth to avoid hanging out with reprobates that i am a good person and i should be making best choices to take care of myself when i open the thin cardboard package i can not help but think of my parents and how much the box represents everything they once told me to be heed of maybe purchasing this pizza is a reflection of my longing to be rebellious or maybe it is a poor purchase in general all i know is it leaves me feeling disappointed and ripped off and that expensive bread is a metaphor of a bad choice as a grown adult sorry mom and as for panago you are selling warm bread never forget", "i like this panago i may be incorrect in my assumption but i believe two brothers own this location they are always so friendly and speedy making our meals the other staff is equally lovely seem generally cheerful which is nice to see in reading the other reviews left for this location i can sympathize and have a tip to ensure you get the best service pizzas order in person unless you are ordering delivery this should not be too much of a hassle i have been mainly disappointed ordering online over the phone little to no cheese skimpy toppings etc everytime i make my order in person i receive the right pizza with the lots of toppings plus if its not to your liking you can address it in person hope this helps fellow pizza eaters", "panago pizza is my second favorite after funky pickle with pizzas like pesto shrimp primo pollo chipotle chicken chorizo and goat cheese and primo capicollo panagos creations are a step beyond same old same old pepperoni and ham pineapple pizzas to make your pizza eating experience even more profound panago offers one free dip or shaker if one does not suffice and believe me it will not you can purchase more at cents each in addition to pizzas panago offers fresh salads and chicken wings cooked to perfection pieces cost which is not really the best deal out there but panagos chicken wings are fresh and crispy and seasoned just right customer service is speedy be it a take out or delivery", "this panago location rocks the delivery is always crazy fast and the food is piping hot it is a bit pricy for pizza but its worth it my favorites are the wings and cheese bread big portions and very fresh", "very good pizza and wings i have been visiting edmonton and had delivery so i have never been in the restaurant but the food was great", "ordered online on my phone as i was reading at the starbucks next door and my pizza was ready to go when i popped in min later hot and fresh and the guy helped me right away i have not ordered from panago in years so i was a little sad that you do not get a free dip anymore ah well its a little smaller and pricier than my usual to go option but it definitely tasted good and i would order again if it was the closest option", "they always get my order wrong order extra ham on half how is slices in total over pieces i have had burned pizza i have had under cooked pizza too the worst though is the customer service once i had the delivery driver leave because i took two minutes literally i checked the time he called my phone to get downstairs in a high rise and offered to resend the same cold pizza in an hour i ordered half and half on a small pizza once only to have the store cook call me himself and scream at me that i had to at least order a medium for that phoned the customer care and they said they could absolutely do half and half on small even the customer care is terrible i ordered a medium half and half today half with extra ham and pineapple pizza comes i tip well open the box and what do i find slices in total over pieces i will upload pictures to prove it i explain a situation as i was heading out of town today and could not wait an hour for my pizza to be remade and redelivered i was hungry then still had to get ready and i was not willing to wait for them to send out another and take back the original well miss there is nothing else i can do for you are you serious are you kidding me screw panago and especially screw this location worst pizza place ever", "they

panago and especially screw this location worst pizza place ever", "last night i ordered the chicken club pizza on line ordering was easy and the pizza was delivered minutes earlier than expected nice however i was very disappointed in the pizza the best word to describe it was dry overpowered by bacon i could not taste the chicken if there had been more than a stingy scattering of chopped tomato it probably would have been better as the few bites that actually had tomato were the only ones that did not send me grabbing for a glass of water to wash it down i thought i would give panago another try but once again i was disappointed and left wondering why i did not order from roadrunner which never disappoints", "panago is the worst pizza on the planetordered new york deli and hard to find meat and the thin cheeze and horrible oregano sauce you could not taste sauce for the tomato paste junk yuk for the oregano was so strong it disgusted us for two large pizzas and the second was meat and peppers and banana peppers the chintzy chili size beef was difficult to find and burned were maybe three chintzy sliceson two large pizzas this is a horrible pizza joint and that is all i can say for flushing down the toilet we spit out and will never order from this cheap junky panago ho place on th and off millwoods dump will not be forgotten rotten and poorly disgustingly put together for the nobodies they think do not know better so shame on them i would have preferred to put but it is not available", "usually panago is great the food is excellent and the service is good however this location is different at this location the lady at the front was rude and unapproachable plus they will not start an order unless they confirm with you over the phone if you actually meant to order something online kind of beats the purpose of ordering online does not it needless to say not ordering from here again", "panago luxury to me i forget when panago first came to canada but it was my best friends first job when we were like and i have been hooked ever since i totally recommend this location i also recommend customizing your pizza to have the jalapeno white sauce if you need a dip chipotle cilantro so good this place is face and professional they got me eating my pizza within like minutes i can not ask for more never had a bad experience i have also ordered delivery from here and it came in like minutes amazing", "fast easy and so good the stuff pizza with chicken and bacon is my favourite the staff are always friendly and helpful and i love how fresh everything is delicious", "picked up another set of take and bake pizzas from papa murphys tonight i am soooooo happy they are in canada now and even happier that they opened this north end location last year so we do not have to drive all the way to the south side for it i love that they use whole wheat high protein flour for their fresh pizza dough low fat mozerella and fresh never frozen ingredients their pizzas are phenomenal and getting to take them home and bake them fresh guarantees that you can cook the pizza to your own liking softer and chewier or crisp whatever floats your boat one of the other great things about papa murphys is that they do not charge you different prices for different toppings not like when you request kalamata olives from panago they charge you an extra and you might get three of them cut in half on your pizza at papa murphys every topping on their pizza fills a full cup and you can sub out any topping for any other topping for no charge you want chicken instead of mushrooms okay you want pineapple instead of pepperoni sure thing there are coupons in the sutp coupon book for papa murphys and with every pizza you buy comes a coupon for a free cookie dough or cheesy bread with your next regular purchase if you take the time to do their minute survey sweet deal i heart papa murphys tonight we picked up my favorite mediterranean chicken consisting of olive oil garlic mozzarella cheese spinach grilled chicken sun dried tomatoes feta cheese delish i uploaded a pic take a peek you know you will want one too take and bake only not a restaurant sign up for their e mail newsletter and receive coupons in your inbox", "pizza is pretty damn good but i went today ordered a topping that was not on the menu not that difficult then the one girl said charge for meat plus a topping so topping is the same as wtf otherwise i love the place", "this was my first visit to any papa murphys i had heard lots of good things and was not disappointed they prepare a tasty pizza and you take it home and bake it for less money than regular take out and it tastes as good or better than anything i could make at home the only thing i would change about this restaurant chain is add more locations", "i am a picky person and this places pizzas are way better than regular pizzerias it was my first time here today and i loved it price is about same but the topping amount is at least douple and spreaded evenly on the pizzanot like small beef piece per slice kind of pizza you get to bake it yourself at home depending on how you like it lady in this place is extremely helpful and patiently explains you how to pick and order it if she was my employee i would advertise a little more open a couple of more pizzeria like this and have her manage them all she is very customer friendly i also had pizza slicer for free for being a first timer here its a small gesture but it will make me come back here again so place is nice and clean management and employee is nice pizza is nice and full of tasty toppings", "so i mentioned in a previous review how staff tried over charging me but my last couple visits came with wayyy past due salads the lettuce was brown and some actually slime already there is also an issue with them making sure you have crouton and dressing pizza is great staff not so much", "first time pizza from papa murphy mm good crust crispy and thin toppings perfect we had a hamburger onions and extra cheese so good we will be back", "i am a fan i like papa murphys as much as i like papa johns my fav classic chain pizza shop from the good old days i have only ever had their pizza with the pan crust where they bake it in butterrrrr i love butter and all the lards my fav pizza from here is some kind of one where there is chicken white sauce and pineapple i am not a fan of pineapple on pizza but this pizza would not be what it is without it i add a smiddddge of hot sauce just enough to warm my mouth and its honestly my fav non traditional pizza i have also had some of their meaty option pizzas that i have to say i am not a major fan of but i could settle for the chicken one for the rest of my life if that is all i could ever have to be honest das all", "omg finally some good pizza this reminds me of order in pizza when i was a child in the s excellent toppings great prices and i got a free inch with my two for one pizza deal we got a greek ham and pineapple it had a funny name like tropical pig plus the free cheese inch super nice staff and they delivered to our acreage which was amazing my year old wrote a note saying we can only order from nitza so all generations were sold on it and if you pick up it says you can get all the slurpees you can carry and they have a kitchen tour tor kids not on now due to covid", "simply great pizza donair pizza is among my favorites tried it on the recomendation of a great friend a few years back and now rarely order from anywhere else prices consistant with the industry and quality has yet to disapoint now a family favorite", "great free slushes good pizza horrible price the size of their large pizza is only a medium anywhere else and at for two its just too much for a large really a medium pizza is a little too high free slushes or not", "stars were only given because the sauce was pretty decent although there was hardly any on each pizza and the cheese was cooked well the service was also fast and they offered a free fountain drink at the till other than that and overall this pizzaflavour was a major disappointment we got the for deal without asking what the price would be and were super shocked when one topping pizzas were they could have been but honestly it would be like how the foot long subs are only the crust looked like it was hand tossed and not cooked in one of those pie pans when we were checking it out online but it was sub par when we actually got the pizza the pepperoni on the one pizza had zero flavour and tasted worse than balongna we had three pieces of pizza each and it was literally like having just one normal sized slice restaurant owners need to figure out that the crust totally makes the pizza and stop giving low quality dough there is no way well be back", "i am a fan of boston pizza i am disappointed with my current location and have waited years for it to improve this is hit and miss usual fare and better if all you want is to have a beer and watch the game food \\mr treliving is making a living i could not be happier for him ha hot food could be as great as always but its not staff do not need my business because there will be someone else to replace me prices are first class result is boston pizza hit and miss mostly miss you done good jim now go away going forward your sauce is and always has been awesome just like boston pizza used to be its still just as good but missing from my pizza raise the price somore and give me some sauce if i order a loaded pizza make sure your staff know enough to give all the toppings a chance to heat up i order your most expensive pizza and its raw everytime my bad", "we ordered pizzas for people over the weekend the pizzas arrived right on time and were delicious each one was made perfectly and our guests loved them thank you montys for always serving quality and very delicious food", "tried this place because i am addicted to donaire pizzas and we can not get good ones in california usually do the traditional pizza which i love so decided to try another spot for once my wife kept giving me the stinkeye because of the price which turned out to be plus with delivery to the windermere area not to mention it came mins after the said delivery window then we tried the food the donaire pizza was really good i like that they put all the thinly sliced donaire meat under the cheese pie style and with the donaire sauce so good i think i like how they made it but i prefer the texture of the pizza dough this had more of a chew but still really good the dressing was something i was not used to on the chicken schwarma salad it was a red chunky vinaigrette type of dressing besides the chicken being a bit dry the greens were nice and crisp making for a good salad the donaire fries were really good but fries are always good in canada the meat was done differently a litte thicker and chewy but a nice change to the usual", "their pizza is unbeatable do not order anything else because you will probably be disappointed but there is no better pizza than this place perfect crust tons of cheese everything you want in a pizza i am a pizza snob and this place seriously makes the best", "if you love traditional style oven baked pizza with tons of cheese then montys pizza is your best choice i have turned montys pizza ever since flamingo pizza close down i have ordered from them several times and have never been disappointed i can not wait to try other things on their menu", "ordered pizza n baked speghitti the pizza was good but the baked speghitti was burnt n dry not tasty pretty much garbage even after i tried to add sauce waste of money definitely", "our first of many pizzas we are new to the neighbourhood and i was looking for a pizza place and i am glad we found montys hands down the best pizza we have had and will be eating here till we die", "was on the hunt for a new mom pop kind of place on the west end since our old favorite will not deliver to our new address we stumbled across this place via google and decided to give it a shot we ordered a chicken burger chicken alfredo baked pasta fish and chips and a pizza they did not disappoint we were quoted minutes delivery and were right on the mark and the food was steaming hot everything was delicious and cooked to perfection and the pizza might have been the best i have ever had tastes just as good for lunch the next day too will definitely be ordering from them again very likely to become our new go to for delivery", "sunday night was my first time to papa murphys and i have to admit that i was somewhat confused on how a business makes money when they make the pizzas for you but yet you still have to bake them yourself i was asked to pick up pizza after work and this location was on the way my motto can not judge something till you try it and i did i picked up family size pizzas all meat and a deluxe veggie and a large pepperoni thinking that it would be enough since larges from pizza or papa johns sometimes is not enough for adults and teens the store is very clean and the staff there is very helpful to new customers the pizzas were more then enough as we had almost an entire pizza left i liked the idea of baking the pizzas myself because the pizzas were fresh and did not have that cardboard box taste to them we enjoyed it so much that my yr old son has applied for a job there and got the call last night for an interview on friday i recommend this place to anyone", "excellent pie as always best pizza in town get one great pizza for feeds two and service is excellent quality ingredients life is short do not compromise", "good bye royal pizza westend after many years of loyalty we have had with your poor service both in the restaurant or for pickup tired of arriving when told then having to wait an extra minutes for the order to be ready for pickup or waiting minutes to be served in restaurant hot food that is cold because service is so slow is not great advertising for your restaurant used to be a great place for pizza not anymore", "this is not a place i would eat at if i were in a rush i had heard of their lunch specials and looked at the menu online we had to go to a nearby store and stopped here after the server asked if we wanted to be at the front by the window which we initially said yes but seeing the dirty tables with crumbs we decided on a table closer to the back there were about other tables occupied so not busy and i saw or staff working there is an open cooking area so i saw staff there after getting our drinks and ordering it took our food at least minutes to arrive maybe closer to which seemed like a long time considering there was one table for waiting for their food before us but at least it was fresh the chicken peppers and onion calzone was big and i ate half there was ample filling but i would have liked more sauce or a dipping sauce the salad was not anything special but i liked the option of raspberry vinaigrette price was good at i asked for a take out box and our server brought one too small so i asked for a larger one we paid our bill and was on our way this is the type of restaurant that is laid back and not high on quick or fantastic service any busier than what it was i would be eating dinner instead of lunch i would come back for the food as that was ok", "first time visiting the west location as we use to order from inglewood having been accustomed to their standards this pizza failed miserably very lacklustre something you would cook at home", "delicious deep thick pizza in all its chewy cheesy goodness now this is not some thin famoso pizza with sparse topping not that that is bad or anything so do not get me wrong but it is more of a throwback to using great ingredients excellent cheese and some odd combinations we are lovers of a few regular items the freds special for sure and my favourite pizza is the vegetarian and me likes me meat you must try it if you like that type of pizza half loaves have always been on my regular order list as well not sure what it is but i love them now ribs are also quite good but i am not a fan of the pastas and that may just be a personal taste service is good and adequate but not star however mostly friendly and seem to enjoy their job which is good but if you like a thick and juicy ste er i mean pizza please try them if you go for a large it may be like but trust me it will feed a horde of hungry people enjoy", "freds special pizza whoever fred is he has great taste haha if you like pineapple pizza which i love yes i strongly believe that pineapple belongs on pizza haha freds special consists of ham pineapple pepperoni and mushroom i usually add extra sauce for free the toppings are loaded and they do not hold back i recently ordered online and went to pick up the pizza within minutes and it was really fresh one of the best feelings of eating pizza for me is when the cheese is still hot and stringy the reason why royal pizza is on one of my top places for pizza is because of their crust it is golden doughy and crispy in the right spots anyone can make a great pizza but if you do not have an amazing crust what do you have", "despite several negative reviews for dining in i picked up pizza on a saturday night it was ready when said one of the best i have ever had great sauce a bit spicy but perfect lots of toppings cheese a lovely crust worth every penny so glad i live close i would definitely recommend their pizza", "asked for extra sauce got barely any plus pieces of the pizza had absolutely no toppings except a faint brush of tasteless sauce plus the dough is roughly inch thick", "horrible service took an hour and a half to get our food and in the end the burger was burnt", "move over pizza boston pizza back of the line funky pickle what this is royal pizzanot lil caesars or pizza hut okmaybe a little overboard but why not i tried the greatest pizza of all time it is called the boss has gone madyes this is the name of the pizza you like spaghettii like spaghetti spaghetti on pizzasnap its the bombdiggity i would like to thank j dawg for introducing this must try yes there are other flavors even a pizza with donair meatwhat is this world coming too hmmi think the next best pizza is going to include salmon or something with creme tartar with some thinly sliced red onion hehehesome of you are probably saying ewor josie grossy but try it first peace out", "royal pizza has been around for as long as i can remember i have been to this location twice both times i got the meat lovers calzone it is delicious though i would not bother takin it home as it never seems to reheat wel", "wanting to try something different we ordered from royal and what a mistake that was we ordered a medium hawaiian pizza and a large double pepperoni with extra cheese they instead brought us a medium hawaiian burnt to a crisp and a ham and pepperoni with pineapple my boyfriend does not even like ham or pineapple for that matter on pizza thanks for wasting our money when that was our treat for the month", "you know i have waited a while before reviewing this place because honestly they pissed me off so i wanted some time to cool off before i gave an honest review first the positive if you order your food via phone and come pick it up they are awesome the pizza is really good crispy crust good topping amount melted cheese just slightly browned over all a great pizza we have ordered pizza to go many many times now the negative my girlfriend and i decided to dine in thinking of our amazing pick up orders we were really excited mind you this is about a month ago as i have been thinking about this review for a long time so we sit down to order minutes later we have someone show up to take our drink order the place is at maybe half capacity not a good start now i am notorious for taking a long time to decide on what i want to order i get my beer finally after about minutes or so and we order our food desperately hungry by this time minutes have passed even me the indecisive diner is ready to order by now we each order a pizza to our liking and while not really impressed we decide to wait it out now i have to add this part as its crucial to this review we both watched tables seated after us one a few minutes after we sat down and one after i finally got my beer about minutes after i got my beer the first table seated after us recieved their dishes ok fine shit happens in a kitchen that is cool i understand minutes have passed no server stops by our table umm ok could be a mishap no problem then i watch the table seated after i got my beer recieve their dishes by this time i have finished my beer about minutes ago and i am waiting to order another one minutes have passed still no server at our table ok i am easy going i flag down a server finally took a minute or two and ask about our pizzas hour and minutes have passed she is awesome but not the lady serving our table she runs to the pass and talks to the cooks i refuse to call these people chefs then runs right back and tells us the pizzas are just in the oven well at this point its been about an hour and minutes and i am sorry i decide to walk out i am not waiting anywhere over minutes for my food and we even gave this place a solid chance as we get to the cash register to pay for my pint of beer our server shows up wow and she is asking us why we are leaving telling us our pizza is just getting cut i inform her politely i might add that after and hour and minutes were not willing to stay and wait any longer for some pizzas she says we can not leave until the manager talks to us say what i am sorry i am not allowed to leave am i a criminal now trying to steal pint of beer as i stand at the register with cash in hand completely insulting i talk to the girl at the register and explain the situation and my bill is literally pint of beer she says do not worry about it its on us ok good deal i thank her as the manager walks up and says we have to pay our bill i explain the situation to the manager she is adamant that our order is ready and we have to pay for it hell no i again tell her that we have been waiting an hour and minutes at this point she finally agrees but still charged me for the beer i mean no apology no how can we help you to make up for this unfortunate incident no that is fine the beer is on us nothing like holy crap i would have at least offered the already cooked pizzas to go for like say half price maybe free i am actually fearful that this place may have held our hawaiian and deluxe pizzas and served these pizzas to the next customers ordering these same pizzas but i have no proof although i did see our pizzas put into a box and our table number pulled but again that is hearsay even now i am still a little pissed off about this incident but i said id give an honest review call in order pizza pick it up wonderful and its the only reason i gave this place star instead of a zero would be more appropriate for the dining in service imho but yelp does not allow that but as always i advise everyone to come and take a look at any place make your own decisions this is just my experience here i recommend having a snack before coming here to dine", "great food incredibly over priced definitely great toppings decent service and delivery times but the prices seemed ridiculously high for pizza and wings one medium pizza and wings plus tip for nearly yikes i guess it makes a good but rare special treat", "hmmm so tonight was not such a good experience unfortunately pizza was hours to arrive which believe it or not i can handle that however the pizza was cold now it is icy and snowy outside the driver was polite and nice and mentioned poor traffic i live in mayfield right up the road so even then i could cut slack however the pizza was just not very good a shade of the usual so hopefully it is just an anomaly but very few toppings on a freds special and had invited a few friends over who had not tried it yet needless to say they were not impressed again my hope is this is a one off but for a very very pricey pizza a thin excuse seldom cuts the er pizza", "what a fckkng joke this place is an order of wings single order and an individual pizza cost their business is one block away from our house and it took an hour to get here never ever will i order from this place again worst customer service ever", "i am old and new to not only edmonton but also to the finer points of social media yet the royal pizza phonelady helped me through the app and the deliverydude delivered me my food hot and on time love this pizza place", "our visit tonight will be our last the three of us wanted to try royal pizza tonight we had ordered meat donairs one of us asked for a tossed salad my daughter ordered fries and i asked for greek salad this was the worst eating experience in edmonton in the past years the donair meat was from a package and microwaved it was not shaved there was tomatoes and white onion in it but this was an incredibly disappointing farce of a donair my wife did not get her tossed salad they brought her a caesar salad with hardly any dressing my greek salad was lettuce purple onion tomatoes and cucumber with a dressing i did not like lettuce in a greek but i also did not get any olives or fetta cheese before we even left my wife and daughter complained of stomach discomfort we will never venture into royal pizza ever again", "if i want to get pizza delivered from royal i have to get it from the west end location its never as good as when i pick up and get it from the hamptons location always inconsistent with their quality last night i ordered and barely any sauce on the pizza and undercooked from now on i will just pick up from the hamptons", "i adore this pizza its my favorite in the entire city okay i almost always have the shrimp and mushroom pizza but its soooo good the dough always tastes fluffy and fresh and the cheese is ridiculously generous they use the shrimp that is the size of a thumbnail not the microscopic kind i am always impressed with how thick it is with the incredible crust toppings and generous cheese its like biting into your own bed after a long day put it this waymy husband hates pizza so he says says the oregano disagrees with him no doubt the heartburn will kick in any time now but it was his idea to buy it ahemyou worked so hard today i bet i know what you would like he smirks a shrimp and mushroom from royal pizza ill even go get it i was planning on taking a picture but my husband had already wolfed three slices and i had to act fast had to eat fast and i ended up stealing the last piece while he was in the bathroom id recommend actually going to the restaurant itself if you are out with old friends and need some time to catch up it makes the wait seem shorter that is my only real complaint is the long wait but just wait until you taste it", "royal pizza west end is a disgrace to this franchise chain it is so poorly operated by the current franchisee that i can not believe the franchisor has not taken it back i have lived in the neighbourhood for years and other neighbours negatively talk about how bad this restaurant is so its not just me they are always understaffed they do not answer the phone for takeout orders and when they do they put you on hold and never come back they do not clean up dirty tables the owners are rude and make excuse after excuse its never their fault never heard them say sorry to any customer in their minds they really think they are doing a great job how can the strathcona royal pizza location which is always busy get it right and this west end location that is dead half the time get it so wrong the answer is management you have been warned to stay away or you can try it and then come back to yelp and add to the numerous negative reviews already posted", "probably the worst royal pizza in edmonton by far horrible service terrible food high prices etc do yourself a favour and read all the star reviews and stay away from this place", "i am a huge pizza snob and glenora pizza has become one of my favourites in edmonton next to tonys and the italian centre their gluten free is a nice crispy thin crust that does not at all taste like gluten free their toppings are super fresh and tasty the only reason they did not get stars is because they have messed our order up a few times i have learned to ask for them to repeat my order to me they are super nice and apologetic when they have gotten my order wrong so maybe they are not perfect but this is a mom and pop place rather than a large franchise which i really like and which makes me give them room for lovely imperfection", "we ordered the donairdblme at and the dblpepmushgrpepper pizzas from this new pizzeria on my suggestion because i wanted to try this new entry in the crowded marketplace let me tell youevery other place i have frequentedevery one of them may as well be selling prepackaged processed frozen pizzas i am extremely confident in putting out into the universe that this is in the top best pizzas i have eaten in edmonton hands down", "had their jumbo beef donair asked for tomato onion extra sauce told them no lettuce what did i get fricken lettuce the flavour was below average they told me they buy the meat already made up they do not make their own service was very slow will not eat there again", "the first pizza order took minutes plus delivery time we ordered one gluten free pizza due to allergies and one personal size pizza delivery guy said hers was not gluten free so he took it back and i called back to reorder the pizza so they sent a replacement but the second pizza was burnt the honey garlic chicken wings were bland over cooked and no sauce on them would not order from them ever again", "this pizza shop is located inside the glenora food mart convenience store they have a full pizza oven and you order from a window in the back the pizzas are terrific they are deep gooey homemade style i have to say that it beats every other quick service pizza like pizza hut dominoes pizza or panago they taste fresher and more homemade you can not go wrong by ordering a pizza here if you would like some kind of special pizza you can request this from the proprietor i do not go anywhere else now for traditional pizza", "the pizza order took minutes was not gluten free and had to send it back to redo the honey garlic chicken wings were bland and hardly had sauce on them would not order from them again", "this restaurant is a hidden treasure in sherwood park why quite simply it has amazing pizza i would highly recommend the donair pizza or the perogy pizza well actually pretty much any of their pizza they also have oven baked bbq chicken and steak which we have enjoyed do not go to this restaurant for the ambience it is pretty bare bones but the pizza is the kind that has thick fresh crust with crispy edges that is sizzling on the plate the bbq chicken was moist and slathered in a scrumptious bbq sauce and they deliver in sherwood park", "ordered a platter from here tonight and it was not good everything was over cooked or soaked in grease and the cheese sticks were more battery than cheese we will not be ordering from here again", "absolutely terriblethis was the worst place i have been to in a long long time i ordered the philly steak sandwichthe beef was tough and dried out and the mushrooms were old hubby had spaghetti and meatballshes not a fussy eater but the meatballs were taken out and left out he did manage to get the spaghetti eaten", "good pizza my butt way over priced for nothing specialgood the burgers we had gotten delivered has been burnt the mozzarella sticks had something wrong with them how do you mess those up seriously got the whole group sick not to mention delivery took an hour and a half and did not even get our full order very un impressed with what they call food", "i have ate at willys a few times and have not been able to find a better pub great service friendley surroundings food is very good and affordable definatly a good way to spend a friday night", "a little neighbourhood place with great pub style food our bike club stops by after rides everyone remarked how tasty the pizza was portion size for my quesadilla was huge and only sampled friends dry rib appetizer and it was also good portion and very tasty small but clean pub with attached clean and bright family dining room good family dining spot", "i can not atest to the rating everyone else is complaining about that certainly seems outlandish but really what do people expect its a diner in a trailer park attatched to a pub and a gas station i have eaten at willys dozens of times over the years perhaps more mostly when working in the industrial area to the north of the yellowhead i have tried almost every pizza on their menu and all their burgers and sandwiches i admitthe entrees and pastas have never really spoken to me for the most partive always left satisfied prices are reasonable food is pretty consistant and still way better than any fast food burger joint they also let you call in your order and they can have it ready and on or almost on the table when you arrive pretty convenient when one only has a min lunch break pizza is pretty good and the individual sizes hit the spot its not fine dining its not trying to be fine dining but as a hole in the wall lunchdinner stopit does just fine keep it up willy ill be back and then ill be back again one day", "thanks for your service and wonderful food each time we have had lunch or coffee there we feel well looked after we will recommend you to family and friends keep up the good work", "for three years i have been going to royal pizza am addicted to the freds specialand then tonightwtf used to pineapple in every bitenot in every third biteand the skinny wings for wtf get that you are losing businessgiving up on quality will do that sorry will not be back you can never make money by ripping off your customers by selling an inferior product goodbye royal pizza i miss you", "last night we had a craving for hearty north americanized pizza after our favourite pizza spot was packed and our second choice was also at capacity we ended up at royal pizza the location is not great and the interior is quite dated neither of those things bother me if the foods is good and at times it can even signify a great meal ahead unfortunately the pizza here did not deliver being in the mood for non neopolitan pizza i did enjoy the thick crust and copious amounts of cheese however the sauce and toppings were not great ie bacon means bacon bits and the price was quite high for what it was it was okay not bad not great i will say the service was prompt and friendly with so many great pizza options in edmonton royal pizza does not quite make the cut", "inglewood is not the nicest place in edmonton however royal is a diamond in the rough the lounge has one of the most friendly neighbourhood pub i have ever been in as a regular or not as a warning a few oddballs will come through the staff is amazing very personable and the food is insanely good of hundreds of meals eaten there over years i would say were not good it is a bit pricey but well worth it", "this is a decent place and ill definitely be back it does not look like it would be anything too special from the outside but the menu is actually pretty good kind of like bps and their sweet potato fries are awesome partially because of the dip i did not actually try their pizza but i hear its good so next time i am there i know what i am getting", "i have already raved about the royal pizza in st albert for their pizza delivery having glanced at the online menu i decided to try a location near my home after noticing that mondays tuesdays are all you can eat spaghetti meatsauce nights i was really craving pasta and i recently discovered that i am no longer allergic to tomato products i was excited to try it out i had not eaten a proper meal in a couple of days keep this in mind when i tell you that i had three helpings that is right three there was an oilers game on tv i went into the lounge part as opposed to the family restaurant area there are two separate entrances inside the main doors the draft beer was a dollar cheaper than id expected but i guess it was happy hour it was not very busy and the wait staff were friendly and reasonably efficient my bill came to less than including tip they have got different specials throughout the week that are mentioned on the website they also have an ongoing small pizza a jug of beer deal considering that money is tight these days its worth checking out for a good meal at a reasonable cost", "i have been eating at various locations of royal pizza my entire life the food is consistently good as is the service the atmosphere is friendly and relaxed i love the pizza but there is a great variety of other meal items as well if you are just not in the mood for pizza", "good hot pizza the crust is delicious the pasta was overcooked though also i did not get feta on my pizza and heard the waitress say to the cooks that you did put feta on the pizza did not you they replied yeah sure then she insisted that they did they also have some codes publicly displayed keo keep eye on and cc constant complainer its a little unprofessional", "some of the best tasting pasta and pizza i have ever eaten the royal pizza location in inglewood has great food at great prices the service is consistently outstanding and the staff take care to ensure their establishment is well kept and clean what more can one say", "my goal in life is to find the best burger and the best pizza i was introduced to royal pizza in december now i drive to st albert to get it two things make a pizza the crust the sauce this is in my top best tasting pizza my favourite is pepperoni pineapple i highly recommend royal pizza for discerning pizza lovers", "i have never been there while it has been busy and i like that it is quiet decent service i sometimes feel a little neglected considering we are usually only one of three tables but you really get what you pay for my two favourite foods in one pizza and spaghetti calzones that are huge the veggie one is my favourite the kid likes it there too last time was her suggestion decent food at decent prices", "okay so my husband and i decided to try this place out as we heard royal pizza was soooo good this is not in a prime location so it was not our first choice we went in the table was sticky the menu was dirty and staff was all chatting behind the bar they were not very enthusiastic seemed like a neighbourhood pub where everyone already knows eachother so service is slow and a who cares attitude the pizza was quite tasty so we left full so we tried it another time by calling we decided to order delivery to my moms house literally maybe five minutes from the actual location they informed us they do not deliver to our address are you kidding me i said we are five minutes away they could not accomodate us so needless to say we will not be returning your a pizza place you should deliver plus vics pizza on th street is better pizza and clean and better service and deliver", "this is a lasagna review takeout i have been searching for a replacement since for a while now with little luck probably the best i have had was from a place on st and whyte in the s where the cheese would get all crusty and brown on the sides wicked and at least an inch in from the outside i requested extra cheese as i did not know how much the was used i guess i would have been really disappointed if i had not as their was just enough for a normal serving their was really a lot to be said i would almost say this was a canned dinner by some supplier it was not horrible it was just nothing special the search continues", "royal pizza is some of the best pizza around for an evening snack eat in take out or delivery its not as cheap as pizza but the prices are reasonable and the pizzas very good this za is not for people who like traditional italian style pies its unapologetically big greasy and american style pizza the crust is doughy and thick and they use tons of cheese they also have excellent pasta here the lasagnas my favourite and the portions are big royal pizza is run by a family and all of the women of the family do the serving they are always friendly and fast i like to stay and eat in where the place smells of pizza and is warm from the oven its a great place to be on a cold edmonton night", "the lovely staff members at this location of royal pizza are let down by underwhelming overpriced pizza", "grandmas is good for a nice greasy pizza they have a good selection of toppings and they are usually pretty fast they deliver in central edmonton and their prices are not bad i am pretty sure they are still cash only though and i have never actually seen anyone who could possible be grandma", "fast delivery great pizza and fair price i ordered the large canadian pizza delivery woman was very friendly as well", "from start to finish everything was aweful i got a flyer in the mail so i thought id give it a try the man on the phone was incredibly rude did not ask my name did not tell me how long it would take or how much it was he was quick to hang up on me after i have him my address and phone number the pizza did not take long to arrive however even though my unit number is listed in the lobby with my buzzer code i still got a phone call later on asking what my buzzer code is then when i go to get my pizza the lady looked pissed and was not friendly at all i go to give her my credit card to pay and she says cash only i told her the man did not tell me that on the phone she said its on the flyer i go back and look at the flyer and its in small print at the bottom the pizza itself was just okay not bad but not good the size was very small i ordered a medium and it was the size of my hand and i am it really lacked any flavour at all i honestly think it might be a drug front because the staff clearly do not give a crap about their customers or their food i would not order from them again nor would i recommend them", "i ordered a beef and onion pizza there was no tomato sauce on the pizza it was under cooked and the crust was soggy the pizza was very bland tasting", "this is the best pizza in edmonton awesome value too and fantastic service i have lived in several cities in canada and the us and this place tops the list across the board i have ordered from several places in edmonton and was not satisfied so kept trying new spots until i found this one i am definitely ordering again and again grandma knows best ten stars", "continuing my quest to find the best pizza that delivers downtown and this might just be the winner so far this is a tiny place tucked under an apartment building so much that when i stopped by in person on a random whim i almost turned around thinking the map was wrong before i saw the tiny sign inside there is a small sitting area that looks like someone is living room up to and including piles of newspapers and dvds around the two small tables you could fit people at each clearly this is mainly a place you would pick up from or phone for delivery its not really a place where you would eat in note cash only the small sitting area ends at a wide counter on the other side of which is a roomy and spotless kitchen area the owner keeps it super tidy and clearly keeps everyone else out of it his wife appears to run the deliveries while hes busy cooking maybe she is the grandma its named after the prices are quite reasonable for a personal size and for a medium pizza but that is on the smaller side for a medium only diameter is between and a pizza will run you delivery is free to downtown and surrounding areas which is great or its also far enough off jasper you can probably find a parking spot to pull into for a pick up i ordered a pepperoni and mushroom and the owner looked a little disappointed he says of what people order are pepperoni ham mushroom pineapple or some combination of those and since he does not make his pepperoni personally he can not take much credit for that he suggested something a little more adventurous if i wanted to be impressed maybe something a bit more mediterranean but sometimes you just want pepperoni and mushroom so that is what i ordered this time it was surprisingly fast and one of the best pizzas i have found so far in the downtown area the owner also threw in a chocolate chip muffin for no apparent reason which turned out to be quite decent too the pizza crust in particular was the best crust i have found so far crispy at the edges but not burned and tender under the pizza but not limp the toppings and cheese were thick and generous and the sauce was tasty the only area id improve would be to find a slightly spicier pepperoni otherwise this was definitely the best pizza i have found in the area so far and i have been searching blaze is probably the only place that comes close but they have only the one size pizza and do not deliver either and they are a big chain grandmas is a genuine mom pop shop which you got to like so thumbs up to grandmas great pizza and competitive prices hidden near downtown edmonton give them a try", "i had grandma pizza at a friends place and it was delicious i thought id try it on my own the man was a little curt on the phone but the delivery was quick and friendly and the pizza was delicious the crust is so good and there is a really nice amount of cheese yum ill definitely be ordering from here again bonus for some reason i got a chocolate muffin extra star points", "the pizza was tasty and they hooked up some fresh fruit and banana bread great customer service too", "on a snowy night where i had no wish to leave my abode i decided to order out for pizza something i very rarely do i had heard about grandma pizza from some friends so i thought i would give them a go i looked up the menu online then phoned my order in to a very efficient gentleman who got us through the preliminaries quickly and painlessly i was told that i would see my order in to minutes but he was way off it showed up in just under min do not go mistaking this for an expectation i live within hailing distance the pizza was hot and smelled wonderful but on first taste it seemed under seasoned this was easily fixed by an application of salt and ground pepper after which the pizza was great nicely cooked lovely crust and chock full of the ordered ingredients bacon and mushrooms as a nice little bonus there were some tasty seasonal treats included this was shortly after christmas nice folks nice food great service if you are in oliver or downtown call yer grandma", "super friendly staff amazing owners who contribute a tremendous amount to the community great weekly specials and a whole slew of free add on toppings for an otherwise already delicious pizza free parking easy access licensed kid friendly", "okay you got the flyer and for some reason it seemed like a good deal its not that is a trick the prices are the same as wherever and you are like grandma yeah i love grandma she is great well i am going to say she is not that great ordered some lasagne ceaser salad and garlic bread it was basically the worst thing ever gave me and my girl the gurgle guts lasagne was crummy mozzarella layer way too much awful sauce bleh meats for days and some totally regular whatever noodles you could not taste them though because of all the sauce remember ceaser salad was a sad sad cry train of lettuce and white flavoured water some mozzarella some crutons i guess garlic bread was a hotdog bun with mozzarella and garlic butter spread maybe should have just went to checkers pizza yeah i said it this place made me long for checkers pizza it made me long for old spaghetti factory it was bullshit", "fantastic service free valentines dessert hot wings are amazing we loved everything and will order again for sure", "i used to order the wing combo frequently from this place when i used to live in their neighbourhood very friendly people clean and fast the wings are awesome the prices are not cheap but definitely worth it with the high frequency of my orders i did get some bad pizzas once or twice but the owner was always ready to listen to relevant complaints and make corrections and after all mistakes do happen normally in rush high volumes orders times i moved far away from the neighbourhood but i still go out of my way to visit this place each now and then and buy my favourite wing combo", "best healthy pizza in edmonton family run business with the kindest owners ever all their pizza is made with whole wheat dough low fat mozerella and lean meats i have had the opportunity dozens of times to chat it up with the owner who is super friendly and passionate about his pizza they cook and wash the fatsgrease off all their meats before seasoning the meat and putting it on your pizza you could order a meat pizza and you still woudnt find any grease on your pizza he always has great specials and really yummy pizzas our favorites are nacho men lean hamburger tomatoes green olives onions and nachos on top also love the thai chicken with lean white chicken breast sprouts cilantro and thai chili sauce i might be forgetting a few ingredients but really really amazing pizza check it out you will not be disappointed of note they have free delivery are open late and its mostly a take outdelivery place they only have a few barstools at a counter against the front window though they do sell pizza by the slice too", "this is definitely in the top pizza places in edmonton for me and its easily the most creative inventive and unique situated on th street unless you have heard of new way you might not know where it is a small strip mall location probably works against it but seems to do good business there are many different types of pizza available but they come with interesting names like bite me and nacho men their website offers descriptions of all the options they also have incredible deals and these specialty pizzas that often have more than toppings are included in the deals all the pizza is made with whole wheat dough and low fat mozzarella cheese you do not finish a meal here feeling tired and sluggish because there is very very little grease the people who work here are also extremely friendly give this place a shot if you are in the area", "as someone who is a foodie and likes to try new places particuarlly now that i am wanting to eat healthier i can honestly say that after trying new way pizzas the dice veggie large pizza minus the zucchinni plus their bread sticks that i am now a new fan of their food if you saw my pizza you would not think that there was no meat on it or that it would not taste that well but it tasted delicious and normally i love a classic deluxe style pizza their veggie version is not only colorful with their ingredients of dice spanish onion onion red pepper green pepper tomatoes zucchini mozzarella and cheddar cheese but quite satisfying to your palate and if you are a vegetarian you will love their dice veggie it has a little bit of a thick crust too which i like their bread sticks i had ordered the garlic cheese toast but they do not offer it anymore so had this instead are much like the ones you would see at papa johns long oblong shaped sticks and you have your choice of various dips i had the ranch which is good the food arrived timely as the guy on the phone had told me in minutes to my door and my total for everything plus a litre of coke was there was a delivery charge as i live north of downtown as their website says their pizza is made with whole wheat dough low fat mozzarella and our very own pizza sauce we offer pizza by the slice catering for parties and free deliveries on orders over a delivery charge may apply for deliveries over kms but they dioffer free delivery on orders and over within kms i have had a few other veggie pizzas from chains such as pizza and papa johns and this is just as good if not better than theirs", "friendly service fast delivery very original specialties so nice to not have to choose dominos anymore they got cheese cakes too they also use whole wheat dough and low fat mozzarella so i am not surprised some people give it bad reviews only fat ignorant people who have heart attacks at would give this stars new way pizza you have a new regular", "love the pizza because its low fat cheese so i do not get bad heartburn also love that the crust is used with whole wheat", "i hate bursting the bubble of love from other yelpers but i just have to while i appreciate their combinations prices and friendliness i will likely not order from new way pizza again why they only offer a whole wheat crust whole wheat crusts do not work for pizza i am sorry if i want to eat healthfully i am not going to order a pizza they place frozen spinach on their pizzas i do not care if they defrost and season the spinach the texture is still unappealing the pizza is very similar to funky pickle if you like funky pickle you will like this but i prefer pizza hut", "inexpensive high quality food with good ingredients not much more needs to be said in my eyes i have gone there at least times now trying many different items on there menu and i must say the cordon blue pizza is a personal favourite i would highly recommend them to just about anyone who enjoys pizza or really good value food", "zero stars sorry but your pizza was the worst pizza i have ever had from the crust to the cheese sauce meat etc you really need to re visit the way you make your pies unappealing tasteless just blah i just thought you better hear it very fresh ingredients but not put together well better step it up", "this is our new favorite pizza place the whole wheat crust is awesome who knew they have a huge selection of specialty pizzas way better than homemade ready right on time and the staff are very friendly my tastebuds and tummy are very happy very filling and just as good the next day", "had new way pizza again last night for the first time in ages we do not live in edmonton anymore so this is no longer our regular pizza joint but when visiting the in laws we love to pick it up i was happy to find that they finally have a website httpwwwnewwaypizzanet which lists their unique pizzas we ordered hawaiian which did not disappoint the toddler and baby too and for us grown ups we tried the beef thai which was excellent love their lean ground beef pizzas and as usual not greasy at all the spicy thai sauce was mildly spicy and sweet i think it was a thai chili sauce mixed with tomato very good so very happy to see new way pizza is still going strong awesome pizza that will not leave you feeling weighed down and super nice staff if you live in the ne and have not checked these guys out yet you are missing out", "new way is basically staple food in our household the quality is always top notch and the service is super friendly i love the low fat cheese and whole wheat crust options my go to is the dice veggie add chicken lol and my husband loves the tropical pig but really everything we have had from there is delicious the price is way more affordable than any other place nearby and were in the delivery range so that works great for us we will for sure be ordering againand againand again", "i have been hunting for a great local delivery place for neighborhood pizza and new way is it for me awesome fresh ingredients the perfect chewy crispy crust and late night hours on weekends could not ask for more the pricing is very affordable and the combo deals are an even better deal i like that there is the option for whole wheat or white crust as well as regular or low fat mozzarella the standard marinara sauce is super flavourful and tomato rich definitely call directly and order rather than using skip the dishes because i think skip inflates pricing to make up for the convenience of online ordering pizza is always delivered hot and fresh definitely am a new way household from now on", "i used to live by the papa murphies in the meadows and loved it i was so excited to go to the one by my new house in sherwood park today i walked over with my family to grab a pizza from papa murphies and a coffee from tim hortons i was disgusted that staff members were smoking outside with their friends right by the door i had to walk through their cloud of smoke to get to tim hortons when we were done at tim hortons they were still smoking so i decided to get my lunch from somewhere else i do not think i will be returning to this location", "i am so happy that papa murphys came to canada a few years back and even more excited that there are so many locations now in the greater edmonton area mediterranean chicken will always be my familys favourite whether on regular gluten free or thin delite i also love that they do fun pizzas like the pumpkin shaped ones at halloween and the heart shaped ones at valentines day sign up for their e mails for discountsdeals and looks for coupons in places like the sutp coupon books sold my schools ill be seeing you soon papa murphys", "came here recently to get take and bake pizza after ordering online staff were very friendly and my order was ready and complete upon my arrival as always the pizza was in good condition and the additional toppings i requested for my order was added in quantity which was really quite great i am sure we will be repeat customers at this location as their rewards program really encourages it and we used to visit another location with frequency in the past", "i am really impressed by their pizza and the whole take and bake model the staff are pleasant and very accommodating i recommend that you call ahead your order it will save you time waiting if you want a good feast buy the stuffed crust pizza so good cooking instructions are dummy proof and the pizza always turns out yummy", "the pizza is great and the service is better i always enjoy supporting this local business because they are always showing how they care about the community and their customers", "my buddy had a coupon for a free topping pizza from papa murphys so we decided to road trip it and give it a try i live in south central edmonton and unfortunately since the riverbend location closed down the next closest one was in the wood so road trip to sherwood park here we go was not worth the trip the toppings tasted fine but it was the doughy bottom of the pizza that absolutely refused to cook no matter what we did we started by following the package directions bottom of pizza is still under cooked we changed settings from broil to bake on the oven and kept it in for longer still nothing we even switched to my pizza tray which i have successfully cooked other frozen pizza on both top and bottom evenly and again put it back in the oven for more time still doughy almost minutes in the oven top of pizza is cooked fine bottom must be coated with something for some ridiculous reason because it absolutely refused to cook at this point i remain convinced you will have to cook their pizza on top of the earths core or on top of the sun because that seems to be the only temperature that will cook the bottom of this pizza never seen anything like this before as a result of this doughy bottom the pizza tasted horrible but as pizza goes even bad pizza is still edible and that is the most flattering thing i can say about this pizza its edible but mediocre it also did not agree with my digestive system considering what happened in the bathroom a few hours later so if you want pizza that is severely under cooked on the bottom no matter what you do and thus tastes like the smell of a diarrhea infused anus then have at it otherwise id recommend going to literally anywhere else where the pizza can be properly cooked on both the top and bottom and not taste like butt", "had a coupon here for a free pizza though it be a good time to use it as i am not often in the area as a total stranger to papa murphys i was delighted to see how knowledgeable and friendly the staff was ended up trying their stuffed pizza option that is basically two pizzas sandwiching the toppings similar to a calzone it was easy to cook and delicious which is perfect for the busy family to get a break the food prep service here works similar to other diy food joints with a couple premium options although the twist is that the food is not cooked so its meant to go home with you and cooked whenever needed aka fill that freezer they seem to have pretty cool kids kits where they can build their own pizza and enjoy it", "what a mistake ordering from here not only did they mess up my order and send mozzarella sticks instead of a cheese pizza but when i called they argued with me that i made the mistake when they finally realized it was an error on their end they told me to come pick it up they were to busy when i asked for a refund for the pizza they had the nerve to say but you received an order of mozzarella sticks i told them to come pick the darn things up we did not order them and do not want them we ordered and paid for a pizza terrible experience and awful customer service do not waste your time or money", "how they are still open i do not know had chicken cordon blue and it was the stuff you get out of a box wings were awful poutine was ok i do not know why anyone would want to eat in this hole", "if you love pizza this place kicks most chain pizza places right in the kisser truly a deep dish style pizza lots of toppings and lots of cheese i have not eaten the other menu items but i love their pizza the decor is a bit dated but they have lots of big tables for groups and a separate room for a private function they also deliver bonus", "our meal was delivered very quickly and everything was hot my favorite dish was the perogies this was the first time i have ever had perogies got it with a side of sour cream the combo of the perogies bacon onions and sour cream was very delicious ordered the lasagna with extra sauce extra meat balls and extra cheese very good lasagna baked spaghetti was pretty good nice layer of cheese on top the nachos were ok it comes in a pizza box on top of a huge piece of tin foil sucky thing is that the cheese melts everything to the foil so its a pain trying to scrape it off and not eat pieces of tin foil in the process the fettuccine con pollo was ok lots of noodles sauce and cheese there was not too much mushrooms or chicken the seafood lasagna was ok lots of noodles sauce and cheese there was not much seafood and the shrimps were very small the caesar salad was good except that the lettuce was a little wilted might have been because it was next to the other hot items", "if you like thicker crust pizza with lots of cheese this is the place i actually found it had too much topping but the others loved it crust is nice and crispy and fairly light price for a topping peperoni mushroom green pepper and shrimp large at is not cheap but the quality is good my wife had the chicken with peppers and mashed potatoes she is gluetin allergic and the first batch came with gravy and garlic toast despite having warned the waitress in advance place has no gluetin free pasta or pizza crusts and is definitely not allergy aware in how they handle food the pizza would have made this a star rating but the very poor attention to what can be very dangerous allergies knocks them way down on the service and customer care side", "went out for dinner with friends i have passed dantanas multiple times and never stopped i have seen reviews of their pizza and decided to try the restaurant as the place to meet up my friends had the steak special and they said their steaks were cooked exactly as they wanted i had a hawaiian pizza i consider myself a little bit of a connoisseur of pizza and i am always wanting to find the next best one my pizza was perfect perfect crust and sauce and the right amount of toppings very flavorful it was cooked to perfection the crust was cooked just right and the cheese was melted and golden brown the right way it should be the service was friendly and welcoming a little neighborhood gem i will be getting my takeout from here from now on it was one of the best pizzas i have had in a long time i recommend it", "i enjoyed the pizza could have been a if it arrived hot i do not live far from the store the sauce is good ingredients were fresh and the crust was nice and crispy maybe a bit too much mozzarella but might have been perfect if it were hot i am nit picking now will try again", "honestly unless you are super hungry and can not make it to th street i would not suggest dantana pizza and steak house to anyone the service we received was not the best it could have been the lady who served us seemed to care less if we were there or not and rushed us through ordering she did not seem to care what we wanted and made us feel like we were a bother to her having worked in the service industry i know this is not a standard most places would be okay with the food was honestly meh between the four guests in my party no one was blown away by their meal i had their bbq chicken which was very dry my so had the perogies and we honestly could have made them the same at home the other two people in our party had the greek salad and the club house sandwich and neither of them were impressed i would not return to dantana but ill let you make your own opinion of them", "i value consistency more than anything else when i order take out this panago location is about as consistent as you get i really appreciate that they are staffed more during high traffic times and i see no lag in service or quality of the food the staff is always friendly here and always with a hi and goodbye i am a fan of their primo capicollo pizza give it a go", "oh sure i am a social butterfly out and about on the town and always looking for fun but sometimes a night in is in order and when one of those rare nights occur what can be better then ordering pizza uncorking a bottle of merlot and watching bad tv we ordered from panago and was not disappointed it was delivered to the house fast and hot with fresh quality ingredients we went with a deluxe hawaiian which was an excellent twist on the classic hp i loved that it had a ton of pineapples on it it drives me crazy when you get a slice that only has or little pieces on it and for something off the menu we had chicken fire roasted tomatos ans bacon on the thin crust it was awesome the crust was super crispy it was loaded with so much chicken i was crazy surprised the tomatoes were lovely and the bacon cooked perfectly panago is definitely our go to pizza for delivery", "i have been to this location a few times parking is a little bit tight but that is just life for you the staff is generally fairly friendly and helpful and eager to please on todays occasion i ordered the usual and was told it would take to minutes i went to my car to blast the ac and was nearly about to go back inside to grab the pizza i was pleasantly surprised because the person that had taken my order brought it out to my car this was a great touch and the pizza was not too bad either", "panago pizza is my favorite take out pizza they have a wide selection available for whatever you are in the mood for vegetarian no meat carne meat pollo chicken oceano seafood or even a simple classis like cheese or pepperoni the reason why i always come back to them is because of the wide selection of pizza they offer their deluxe hawaiian is a favorite especially if you ask for canadian bacon instead of ham italian deli is a great choice for any meat lovers bbq steak is always cooked just right and the chicken club always wins over your party the price range is fairly average for the pizzas as well from for a specialty small to for a specialty if you are really picky they even have an option of creating your pizza from scratch you select the crust followed by the sauce then add cheese then toppings the wings offered are good but not great there is nothing special about the price either for most pizza places do not offer great wings anyways they offer a wide selection of dips yet japapeno ranch and italian garlic keep on being chosen by my group you get a free one with every pizza but as mentioned before these will not last panago has recently begun offering organic lemonade and juices i have not tried this myself however a few friends commented on how overly sweet it tasted fresh salad is also available for the health conscious people out there as well this particular location had really fast service we arrived minutes earlier than we were told to be and the pizza was ready this was on a sunday night customer service was good with fast and friendly service", "this place is usually good to satisfy our occasional pizza cravings especially on an evening when we are in the mood for take out which is not quite often i am amazed at the wide variety they have in terms of the pizza base as well as the toppings i have enjoyed their hand tossed whole wheat pizzaeven though its an indulgence it just feels good to know that its made of whole wheat the ordering process has been quick and the pick ups have been prompt except for this one occasion where i had to wait an extra minutes beyond the promised time because apparently my pizza was bubbly and did not turn out the way they liked well its good to know that you guys have quality control in place", "these guys are fast we have had the owner of this one deliver to us multiple times and give awesome coupons as well they make a great product i usually get the gluten free crust vegetarian option with goat cheese extra pineapple and jalape\u00f1os the other pizza is typically a whole wheat thin crust sicilian with banana peppers every time we order we do so online and the time for delivery usually arrives within that time frame the pizza itself is always hot they do not skimp on the toppings and it tastes fresh i have zero complaints this company has a good thing going for them one timemy cat actually bit the pizza guy of course i freaked out at my cat daddys orange little angle of hissiness the pizza guy was good about it and just asked if he was up on his shots i said yes he told me it was no problem and not to worry i was very embarrassed but the guy was cool about it cheers enjoy that pizza", "this

and i wanted something quick while watching a movie i had also tried before the pasta alfredo and it was ok but nothing impressive anyway it is a pizza place so i guess my choices were not the right ones", "i got to say i am a little bit surprised by all the one star reviews but we ordered delivery here and you know what they say about ignorance being bliss so perhaps we would have been less satisfied if we went into the actual store to order at this time though i still feel comfortable giving them a solid five star review our pizzabread sticksand brownie all showed up well before the time quoted also the gentleman delivering did not have that self entitled attitude you sometimes find with pizza guys when it comes to the tip and seemed genuinely appreciative for what we gave him the pizza was absolutely delicious i do not think i have ever gotten a take out pizza that was this devoid of excess grease where it seemed i could almost taste every flavor of each individual ingredient used i am also not sure what they use as seasoning on their bread sticks but it definitely makes them stand out from the breads offered at other establishments all in all i would say this is the second best pizza i have ever tasted and we will for sure be ordering again", "i found the online ordering a breeze until my internet went out i called the store to order they were helpful and knew the specials well i decided to pick up the store is clean and i seen a lot of hand washing pizza was cooked and boxed well also very yummy", "what an absolute rip off for this little crap pizza never again will you get my money or anyone else i talk to for that matter what a disgrace of a pizza shop your quality and quantity are both lacking might as well just pack it in now its only a matter of time anyway with this garbage", "ordered the spicy wonder and chicken wings the pizza tasted similar to delissio frozen pizza but not quite as good the wings are obviously just frozen wings they threw in the deep fryer if we did not use the groupon it would have been a huge ripoff save your cash and just get a frozen pizza over this place", "very trendy place and great food was a good price and the food seemed as though everything was super fresh the staff is very friendly it was a great atmosphere and the take out is always good although we love to dine in it is always made easy to call in and place an order i recommend this restaurant to anybody and i am sure you will not be disappointed", "ended up coming here through a groupon deal and was very impressed nice modern decor with menu options we purchased the xl supreme pizza and it was delicious not greasy at all and loaded with fixings i was also impressed that they brought lego to the table as soon as we got there as we were with a child the lego not only did it entertain my year old but also my fianc\u00e9 would definitely come here again", "we ordered pizzas tonight the ham pineapple was dry with a gritty texture of cheese no flavour at all the pepperoni mushroom pizza was good flavourful and nice sauce cheesecake was not cheesecake lol would not order from them again", "the pizzas are amazing chicken wings too really good prices and they have a hood variety in the menu", "this place is not a bad pizza place the pizzas were good and the atmosphere pretty neat do not order the wings you are better off buying frozen wings from the store", "great atmosphere for a sit down for a quick bite as well as a full dinner went with some friends for dinner was pleasantly surprised by the great food and friendly staff definetley will be back again", "fresh cut in house toppings and a great crust some unique indian fusion pizza worth the drive to the east side", "good pizza nice premises and friendly proprietors and staff what is not to like oh yes the prices are what we should not like bring them down about and then you have got a recipe for even greater success", "traveled south to try this pizza after reading about it on the baconhound blog and let me say i was not disappointed i ordered a small spicy italian creamy garlic sauce mozzarella pepperoni onions black olives jalape\u00f1os cooked tomatoes and italian sausage and it was fantastic this is a pan style pizza so it had a nice crispy crust the toppings were abundant and if you like garlic this is your pizza they serve the regular peppers and cheese on the tables but also offer ranch for dipping which was nice to dip the ends in my lunch companion ordered the creamy garlic supreme calzone garlic sauce mozzarella pepperoni mushrooms black olives green onions cooked tomatoes and italian sausage and let me say it looked amazing they said it tasted just as good as it looked lots of cheese and filling and meat sauce for dipping restaurant is clean and has lots of seating three big screen tvs if you need to watch tv while eating the server was quick efficient and friendly for two including soft drinks and a starter cesear salad was about including tipwhich given the amount of food served is well worth it all in all id say its worth a drive", "place was very clean and staff very friendly food was really good pizza had alot of toppings but not to many that it made the pizza too heavy the quality of pizza reminded me similary of boston pizza but with less grease i would deffinetly recommend and will be going back", "had pizza from here times really good service the pizza is the best i ever had i wod suggest to have the bar separate from the people that do not drink", "thin slices of beef and noodles in a steaming hot bowl of soup the price for pho here is fairly reasonable with a simple yet appealing presentation its very strange for a vietnamese restaurant to also sell pizzabut i have tried the pizza here and its actually really good the crispy crust is what makes there pizza famous a lot of my asian friends really like take out pizza from here the owner here lisa and her family are very friendly i have notice that they know the names and faces of many of there customers here this restaurant is unique in name and also one of the few places that does delivery which sets them apart from so many other restaurant lots of parking in front and you will be pleasantly surprised by how tasty the food here is so do not be fooled by the location and what it looks like on the outside its what is inside that matters", "let us be honest pizza and pho is one weird combination i have tried everything on the menu and its all good however i am not a huge fan of the pizza its not bad by any means but i like there vietnamese way better the dumplings are handmade and so tasty i love every type of pho they have oh and today i had the lemongrass pork chops with rice and spring rolls i love it friendly service family owned and great food the only downer is that its located in a sketchy ass area and people have no idea how to park in that parking lot so sometimes you get boxed in overall fantastic", "i like this place i like it a lot i have been coming here for years and always get the noodles never disappointed the service can be kind of lacking though still the food makes up for it i have heard they make a pretty decent pie too extra marks for quick delivery", "i am vegetarian and i visited yesterday and there was only one option noodles with vegetables with spring rolls spring rolls were overly deep fried almost tasting bitter overall it was pricy not going back there", "the pho is authentic and delicious the vietnamese nibbles are deep fried and yummy as you would expect and the surprise the pizza is solid too great value and friendly service and the other customers were a hoot strangers that talk to you without making it weird fun ill be back", "by far our favorite pho place in the city the broth is amazing the amount of noodles and meat that come with it is sometimes lacking but its still worth it they also have great pizza and vermicelli noodle dishes they deliver", "so good love the wonton soup and the chicken pho we get delivery everyday basically delish", "lovely bright and clean place with excellent food the pho was one of the best bowls i have had recently the steak was tender and the brisket was reasonably lean while the broth was delicious my lunch companion loved his chicken vermicelli bowl i had a taste of a piece of chicken and thought it was also excellent prices are in line with most vietnamese places and the staff is friendly the onion cakes were light and fluffy and not greasy at all i highly recommend pho huong to any vietnamese food lover", "i come here all the time with my boy friend and our friends the restaurant is clean and tidy the pizza is delicious we always get the its not too greasy the sauce is sweeter and there is no shortage of toppings they have some of the best green onion cakes we have ever had and the pho has a great broth flavor my boyfriend is not normally a huge fan of pho but hell eat it here and the portuons are large its the perfect combination who does not love pho or pizza we highly recommend this place people who complain about service you do not come to these places foe fancy service you come for the food", "i was really curious about this place after jonny m praised the pizza as well as the bun bo hue i love both so i thought why not give it a try i popped by for lunch not too long ago and was pleased to see that it was not completely empty about half full with people of all nationalities the space is very clean and modern not your typical hole in the wall joint there is a parking lot in front but only the spots in front of the restaurant are reserved for it and i ended up having to park on the side street i knew i wanted bun bo hue so that is what i ordered by the way their menu is available on their facebook page i was given some strong chinese tea and a plate of sprouts thai basil and lime i guess not everywhere does the shredded cabbage the noodle soup did not come out quite as fast as it does at pho hoan pasteur i think i have gotten phobun bo hue in minutes or less there but it was relatively quick at first glance piles of meat turns out you only get brisket with this but the cut had the right blend of fat to meat so i really liked it the broth was light and had a subtle taste of lemongrass but it was not strong enough for my liking one thing that was different and perhaps it was an error in my bowl was that it had rice stick noodles like the kind you would get in pho instead of the round bun rice noodles i love the bun style noodles so this was a disappointment as i got further into the bowl i realized that there were way too many noodles for me as is often the case because i prefer the soup and toppings however i thought it was an appropriate amount for a generous portion of meat onto the pizza takeout dinner a different night they do have a few deals listed on their fb site but none that i wanted to take advantage of i almost always want toppings is not enough i decided to order one of my favourites an all dressed quebec style which has pepperoni green peppers and mushrooms i was told wait time would be about minutes but i was called after minutes to let me know it was ready for pick up nice touch the pizza looked really good it looks like rose bowl pizza but rose bowl is better evenly cut pieces a good layer of cheese toppings evenly distributed thinly sliced mushrooms so there were not any raw pieces the green pepper surprisingly i found was too cooked for my liking however as leduc n noted the sauce is on the sweet side at first we thought it might be the dough because often asian breads are sweeter than their western counterparts but we were able to figure out that it was in fact the sauce personally i did not mind it but my caucasian husband did never mind that he still ate it all pizza is still pizza it just turned what could have been a stellar pizza into a less good one i could not decide if this place was a or star for me i would have the bun bo hue again even though it was not perfect i really liked the brisket i would even order the pizza again if i was flying solo for the night what ended up tipping it to a was the good service the owner was super friendly and i would be willing to try out some of its other offerings ps they take visa", "pho huong has been in this location for as long as i can remember but it recently received a bit of a facelift and caught my attention once again i ate at this restaurant prior to the renovations and thought the food was wonderful but the seedy appearance of the restaurant and the unsavory characters that seemed to accumulate around it were enough to keep me away which is why i am glad they have renovated i know that this restaurant is a family business and they try to cater to all demographics offering traditional vietnamese fare as well as pizzaburgerswestern food do not let that sway you from visiting the vietnamese is great i love the colors vermicelli bowl all of the meats were super delicious and perfectly cooked along with a bowl full of fresh beautiful veggies and vermicelli i love that you get a lot of great quality food for a low price i can have lunch for less than which is awesome the new renovations to the restaurant are absolutely gorgeous lots of care went into their changes and they did the whole restaurant from top to bottom beautiful simple decor and fixtures throughout i have had pho in lots of seedy vietnamese places in the last few years and this is my new favorite spot because of its touch of comfort and class i have to admit that i have not tried any of the western menu but my boyfriend did point out that the addition of all that is great for bringing out friends who are not big fans of vietnamese him and his office love going out for pho but there is always one or two individuals who do not care for it pho huong is the perfect lunch spot for a compromise in my last visit there the owner came and introduced herself as well as bringing complimentary drinks to the table it was a very nice gesture and i definitely hope that her business gets the attention it deserves especially after the new renovations pho huong provides great food fast service and great value and now its pretty definitely worth a try", "great pizza fairly healthy the salads are quite small though", "solid pizza not my favorite but then neapolitan pizza is inferior to ny style but always a good choice family friendly good prices and the pizza is always made with quality ingredients i am always a bit miffed by the ordering myself and then someone serving it but cest la vie the sandwiches and soups are good too in summer they sometimes turn off the ac which is a little annoying but otherwise a good pick", "neighborhood quality pizza within a business building there is outdoor parking as well as patio small elongated space on the inside booths and high tables available you walk in and right away you see the front menu give yourself time because there is a lot of options the staff will help you if you have questions or can not decide fire oven pizza can not go wrong tried the spicy thai and it was great love the thin crust i like the waldorf salad but a few times they have forgotten my chicken dessert who says no to tiramisu i have also had the afrogato and have not been disappointed your choice to sit down or take out family friendly i took out and service was not busy so go the piping hot pizza right away", "went there for the first time based on my sisters recommendation first off the staff at this location were very friendly when we mentioned that we had never been there before our waitress and the host order taker walked us through the process of selecting our pizzettas lunch meals and then walking to the counter to order recommended appropriate portions checked for allergies effectively and encouraged to pay at the end of our service in case we wanted gelato there were five adults and three kids the kids each had a kids meal with a combination of pepperoni or ham and pineapple pizza chocolate milk and one scoop of gelato there were about flavors of gelato they could choose from four of the adults had two large pizzas and one small pizza one adult had the lunch special the two large were the funghi a mix of mushrooms truffle oil and cheese and korean bbq both were excellent i enjoy mushrooms and love truffle oil hence the funghi the korean bbq was a good mix of korean bbq meat savouriness with a little spice we also had a small was a primavera which i did not try myself but my wife good the pizza crust is light and not greasy more traditional italian style the kids had the mango pineapple mint chip and blood orange creamscicle thumbs lunch came out to about so a little on the pricey side for pizza but again the service was fantastic friendly prompt and attentive and well informed definitely a location worth going to a little tough with a large party over six people but good food and friendly folks", "great if you want fast takeout its so fast that i never call ahead the pizza only cooks for four minutes so its great for a quick order i was literally in and out in less than ten minutes friendly efficient service even though it was hopping busy i had the primavera artichokes kalamata olives etc great veggie pizza on an authentic italian thin crust i have also had their lunch special of a pizzetta and small salad with gorgonzola and walnuts really good", "mondays pizza is so good but you have to eat it the moment it comes out of the oven to your table otherwise it will be soggy and tough so dine in is best fast service caesar salad is exceptionally good lunch special is a very good deal", "stick to their pizza never try their dessert especially the panna cotta was a bit of a fail pizzas are still pretty good if i were to rate this place solely on dessert i would give it a", "went there for dessert their gelatos are always great must have the tiramisu it is so delectable strong and robust in taste", "very good thin pizza the owner is great and very helpful sometimes there can be a bit of a wait and ladies at checkout somewhat disorganised but worth the wait for a good product", "i have been going to this bps since and i have one word for the five star rating manager the manager that runs this place has always been one of the best out of any resturant i have been too he always smiles and if you let him hell tell you a joke or two when i first started going here it was always a hour before they closed and he would make sure i was taken care of and my friend until the very end even it meant past closing time now i go during normal supper hours but i still get awesome service from him and the staff love the food too so that helps i never go in the bar much but it is a fair size with lots of room", "bps one of my favourite places to eat westmount has great service and good delivery times the menu has grown over the years but for my money they still have the best pizza and they make a killer caesar", "stars for this bp on pasta tuesday walk in and no wait even on a tuesday different pastas all delicious a small boston royal pizza requested well done so the onions are crisp it arrived just like that the salads were fresh love the half price oz wines the beer feature was a winter ale from granville island perfect for a chilly fall night service is attentive prompt and tailored to our table", "after a recent visit to this bp location i am adjusting my previous review this visit included waiting for a table the restaurant was busy but not full so the wait seemed unnecessary the server was very good the food quality was questionable certain things were fine the desserts for example the salad thoughit should not have been served i ended up picking out most of the lettuce due to discoloration and the level to which it was wilted at the risk of sounding pompous the wine selection was limited i love the central location and the service provided by the servers but the food did not live up to the famous bp reputation", "this is a solid boston pizza joint its usually busy in the bar side with sports on the tvs service is good beer is cold food is consistent though the nachos do suck avoid them as far as boston pizzas go this is good one", "no complaints here i have only been here to the lounge area for drinks with friends and the variety seemed to suit our group it was a bit loud with the hockey game on we were not there to watch but otherwise it was pretty good i enjoyed my hot chocolate with whipped cream which was a nice way to end my day", "come here often slots pay well have won about and lost about over the last year food is pretty great the meteor pizza is pretty is delicious waitresses are pretty good in the lounge they look exhausted most of the time but still manage to work a lot and do a pretty good job", "an update we went here with a party of for a birthday dinner you basically know what you are going to get when you go to bp the pizza is really good get thin crust less filling but same good taste a few people had pasta and all was well this location has ample parking there is televisions all around its comfy i was surprised you can not get air miles anymore and there is no scene points it just seems that for such a mainstream restaurant there would be some loyalty program", "this is not my favorite boston pizza in the city but its a pretty good one i usually get the same things when i go into a boston pizza because i know what i like the cactus cut potatoes were good just like they always are the service was not great here it was not horrible but our server was not very smiley so that put a bit of a damper on my perception of her she did her job though the atmosphere was different here maybe its just because it was a different side of the city and a different crowd but it was a bit different from what i am used to i am not sure if it was good or bad though i was surprised that there were not that many people at this bps overall it was a good time not the best but good", "decided to try a different pizza place and was pleasantly surprised the staff is pleasant and efficient tried the february special salad pizza and desert very good it is close to where i live and will definitely return", "royal pizza makes the best pizza in the city by far unless your looking for the fancy european pizza and they have oz pints of original for on sale right now there new location is quiet and clean we had the royal special and it was great they have perfected a crunchy crust", "nice staff nice spot and great food have a pitcher maximum which some staff enforce and some do not", "our family of all ordered different items and love them all pizzas pasta and salad i highly recommend the baked penne with red meat sauce the hawaiian pizza was good too from the outside it does not look like much but inside its new and clean too bad we live hours away or we would definitely be back", "pizza is good and they have lots of other menu options i find it to be on the expensive side for what you get though so would choose other places over royal for better value especially if feeding a group", "got take out it was delicious nice crispy crust just the right amount of cheese have parmesan and chili flakes i think it is my new pizza place in edmonton", "major disappointment here i was really looking for a decent meal i went in for lunch and ordered the meat lovers calzone it look great when it came out but half way through i noticed the dough was not cooked all the way upon closer inspection i found a large amount of the dough was not cooked needless to say i will not return", "i have been facing a major crisis living in the deep south of edmonton of not being to find a pizza place that i can swoon over my favourite joints are largely in the north side and the major chains pizza hut panago just does not do it for me my colleagues highly recommended royal pizza a chain that has been expanding all over the city i was sceptical but i was intrigued i gave it the old college try in a location on elerslie i ordered the meat lovers pizza to me this is the litmus test that is either going to be an amazing celebration of a carnivores paradise or a cheap presentation of chopped up bacon bits ham and meagre sprinkles of sausage on a soggy crustto my delight i was blown away by it the meat was plentiful the crust was chewy and delicious the only knock was the complimentary parmesan cheese was a gross store bought granulated powder overall i can now sigh in relief that i have an awesome pizza joint close to my place that i can embrace without having to compromise to some lame mega national pizza chain papa john eek", "extremely overpriced for what you get my companions had unlimited pasta id skip this and the other had a calzone again not impressive i ordered create your own pizza it comes deep dish and very expensive after all its pizza environment is plain and staff is rather drab the pizza is taste good and if i were to return which i probably will not it is the only thing id have", "i started coming to royal pizza back in july and have become a regular customer ever since visiting at least twice a week for their amazing pasta and pizzas my regular server dreana is simply the best and has become a good friend over these past few months as she is so warm personable friendly and attentive always greeting me with her big bright welcoming smile as soon as i walk in i especially love their greek salad spaghetti and meatballs lasagna and salami pizza rotating through these delicious flavorful items on each visit keep serving great food delivered with exceptional customer service and you will have a loyal customer in me forever", "in town from because and was looking for a place to have dinner after an extremely busy day visiting clients went to yelp for help as there are way too many restaurants to choose from service was excellent the server was very attentive and helpful ordered a pizza and was not disappointed delicious golden crust flavourful toppings and the right amount of cheese you tell if a pizza is truly delicious when it has completely cooled down and the true flavours come out tempted by the leftovers i had a slice and it tasted even better thanks royal pizza you did not disappoint", "you know the pizza is out of this world when you make this your first stop after flying into edmonton from because best pizza i have ever had", "i went to this location to purchase pizza upon arrival i was informed that the special i went there for was available only if i ordered online they would not sell me the deal at the store i went home and registered a complaint with the papa johns help line they told me they would pass that along to upper management well upper management turned out to be the franchisee and he barely offered up more then an i am sorry i go back days later to purchase another promo i read on the wall while i was there it to was only available if i order online this evening which is days after the second visit i order online and their promotion code does not work call customer service register a complaint am told that i can be transferred to the acting store manager and i will be looked after the person i spoke with was not the acting manager and the deal they offered me in compensation for there advertised deal that would not work was a slap in the face at the very least well strikes and they are out yes i lost my cool a little and cursed a tad but really how hard does it have to be to order large thin crust pizzas with two toppings so yeah if you are willing to just pay what it costs at the counter then i am sure you will love their pizza if you are like me and order there at least once a week mostly pickup but on occasion delivery i would recommend spending your money at a place that realizes we all do not want spam email or ad texts or any other type of advertising that is all i will get ordering online", "this is my favorite papa johns location the staff there are very careful with their orders they really know their menu very well i like that they make suggestions for you based on your past favorites this location is open till midnight the only location in the west end that opens this late they are also close to downtown which makes them prime location overall papa johns is in my opinion the most delicious pizza try the chicken spinach alfredo highly recommended", "this is my first and i think last time i order from papa johns i did not like their online order page for one i did not find it very user friendly i wanted to order shrimp and mushroom all i managed to find was a menu of their signature stuff and some weird page that added or removed toppings from a baconpepperoni pizza whatever i order the special pepperoni bacon pizza and some bacon cheese sticks i just looked at my receipt and it says i ordered the thin crust that must explain why its so flat but it does not explain why its overcooked and the bacon cheese sticks were burnt on one side it just is not very good i never thought id eat pizza that i did not want to eat for breakfast the next day i am just going to throw it out", "its been a long time since pizza hut meant a special sit down family dinner with ice cream afterwards i have a lot of nostalgia when it comes to pizza hut but let us be honest their actual pizza can be really hit or miss that being said i have ordered pizza from this location a few times now and so far i have been pleased every time i enjoy their stuffed crust and they often have some worthwhile specials", "we got a pizza delivered to us last night by noel she was quick and friendly we were really happy to get our pizza hot and quickly would for sure order again", "the worst pizza i have ever had and they found a way to make boneless wings gross", "killing my insides and trying this pizza so you do not have to yesterday i saw the ig ad to try the pizza hutkfc pizza colab its a pizza hut pizza with sweet corn popcorn chicken with a kfc gravy base if you are craving pizza do not get this it was okay tasting but definitely just tasted like you mashed a ton of stuff together on your fork and took a big bite nothing about this pizza was pizza accept the shape i guess if you into trying new limited edition items restaurants launch then this is worth the try otherwise save your money or order your favourite pizza combination", "just wanted to send a thanks to your sherwood park baseline road location i had messed up my online order and they were quick to remedy the issue i had a phone call yesterday to double check the delivery time that is what i had messed up pizza arrived today with an awesome delivery guy on time and super fresh i had a semi large order and they made the food part of the birthday we were hosting a lot less stressful", "its ok cost is high pizza was ok but does not justify the cost will not go out of my way to eat here again though", "i have been back to slice several times and the pizza remains very good generous toppings and quality ingredients tonight our pizza took well over a half hour so that we had to ask for boxes to take them with us we just ran out of time overall still a quality place to eat with very friendly and competent service but definitely not a place to go if you are in a hurry", "love this little local pizza joint its close to my house and better than the big pizza restaurants great place to watch the game and have a few beers too", "i have recently move to the meadows and have enjoyed checking out all the cute little restaurants in the area i am a huge pizza fan so i had to check out slice the name really is misleading i was hoping for just a slice but that was not an option so i opted for a post walk girl date with my bestie and her toddler son when we arrived we were promptly greeted and ushered to our table they offered a booth to make it easier with a kiddo in stow our server was friendly patient and not pushy a great quality when you are dining with children the pizza was fantastic i opted for the meat lovers style pizza and they were happy to swap out one of the meats for something green got to be healthy once in a while right lol it was just thick enough and just cheesy enough exactly how i enjoy it from what i gather the slice now offers delivery can not wait to indulge", "went to slice pizzeria for the first time with a group of on canada day according to their little bio on their menu the ideaconcept is based from california anyways the place only had a few people in it not surprising as the restaurant is located in milhoods that is right i spelt it that way anyways for the food we decided to share a few pizzas and order a few pitchers of beer to celebrate the old red and white festivities i like how they have the number of slices on the menu for each size offering ie xl slices three of us shared a spicy wonder xl nice heat to it from the jalapenos good amount of cheese onion and pepperoni note if your hungry or dudes like my two other buddies that i shared this with go with the xl its not as big as you may think slices each is good enough for me though three shared one of the created your own pizzas large for extra toppings one had the supreme mini comes with cheese salami pepperoni mushrooms bell peppers onions olives chorizo and italian sausage my friend did not want the italian sausage but they were nice enough to put it on the side and give it to another friend that wanted to eat it x on tap beer pitchers each choose rickards red molson or coors for your tasting pleasurenot the pizzas were good not greasy good amount of cheese nice crunch and doughyness to it if you live in the milwoods area definitely go check it out over any of the lame edmonton pizza chains the ownerchef came out to talk to us after our meal and told us everything is made in house and fresh everyday", "the food here is good especially the pizza it was not bomb diggity good but it was good enough its hard finding good pizza around here so when you find a place you like just stick with it i recommend coming here", "we had supper here the pizza was great the wifes pasta was delicious even better the absolutely amazing hospitalitynot service but straight up hospitality check these guys out", "i also tried slice because of the glowing recommendation of the baconhound either i got my hopes up too high or i just have higher standards we dined at the restaurant on a saturday night and it was not busy the waitress was friendly and the service was quick but the pizza was not all that great perhaps it was an off night but when we got our hawaiian pizza the crust was the downfall the toppings were ok sauce and cheese were fine but both my wife and i had the exact same comment regarding the crustt was about the equivalent of a frozen pizza you would bake at home dry and stiff underneath and not much thickness for a non thin crust pizza overall it was ok at best but after the hype from the blog i was expecting some great thick crust pizza", "we periodically order from slice because its close to our house the pizza is really good i usually get a little healthy slice pizza which has cheese artichoke hearts spinach chicken and tomatoes my boyfriend usually gets chicken wings and a pepperoni pizza i have tried some of their other menu items spaghetti chicken fingers cesar salad but its nothing special the pizza however is always really good i find the restaurants atmosphere a bit off its always really dead in there as most people get takeout we sat down to eat there once and it was just not a very warm dining atmosphere having said that the staff are all nice enough so i wish i could give them and a half stars", "good pizza thinner crust good amount on it had hawian and meat lovers and was great taste the pop was not very good though was quit flat no taste", "great great pizza i lived in manhattan and tried lots of pizzas and this place measures up to any nyc pizza", "this is a nice clean little place to eat a variety of pizzas including traditional and specialty i had a buffalo soldier pizza which had jalepenos chicken and green peppers which were plentiful i am not a fan of their crust which is a little on the dry side and harder than i prefer similar to millcreek pizza it was a good choice if you like spicy i liked how they have the option to purchase two litre bottles of pop i also liked how they put a squeeze bottle of ranch on the table along with chili flakes and parmesan cheese the service was prompt and friendly in the winter it can be cold sitting by wall closest to the door as a cold breeze will come and hit you every time some one comes or goes it would not be my first choice for pizza but i would give it another try if in the area", "great great pizza i lived in manhattan and tried lots of pizzas and this place measures up to any nyc pizza", "in edmonton tonight at a hotel and decided to try a home grown pizza had the traditional supreme pizza it was exceptional crispy crust great flavours things always get soggy in delivery but it held up and was great would be nice to visit the restaurant and get some other flavours good job slice", "a fantastic neighbourhood pizzeria eat in pick up or delivery are all options for getting their pizza the restaurant is simply yet tastefully decorated and the staff are very friendly and helpful my husband and i both ordered mini size pizzas which were perfect for a light sunday supper the crusts are not super thick but they are not thin crust either crispy with just the right amount of cheese on top my veggie pizza was loaded with artichokes mushrooms olive onions and peppers and topped with little slices of fresh tomato this is definitely our new go to pizza place", "usually order pizza wings and wedges they are all good definitely my replacement for pizza employees are nice and pleasant to deal with their drivers love what they do and they do not feel cold blunt attitude when dropping off food to your home door sometimes the owner will do deliveries which is a nice touch because he asks for feedback", "i love bringing my family here kids are not shunned here and the girl serving us was wonderful this is a great place in my neighbourhood", "when you suddenly have that smell of cooked cheese and that marinara sauce in your brain and can not get it out when you are feelin for that gooey cheesy goodness you know all you want is pizza i had that feeling a few days ago but i did not want to leave the comfort of my home i searched delivery on yelp and found slice pizza i have never been there or heard of them and they deliver so why not try them out checked there menu online and saw calzones what i am definitely getting that my partner is a calzone lover so he needed to have his fav pep and salami with extra cheese i got the veggie with pineapple less than mins later knock on the door and there was our meal the delivery person was professional and friendly i was happy with my calzone the veggies were plentiful and so much cheese yumm the best part was they did not cover the top with pizza dough so the taste was much like a pizza but more toppings it was so filling i could only finish half save the rest for later my partner enjoyed his fully because his was all gone in less than mins i believe we enjoyed this so much we decided to seek them out after work a few days later for take out we ordered the exact same meal and sat waiting in the restaurant the restaurant was clean and modern with a full bar if we were not so tired after work we may have stayed and had a couple of drinks we decided next week we will have supper here the menu has lots to offer so next time i think i am going to try something different maybe a specialty pizza like the greek india or the butter chicken it all sounds sooo good ill definitely be back", "ordered extra large pizzas for my crew order was on time price was decent and the food was great next time were going to eat in and spend some money in this little gem", "our go to for pizza always hot and delicious at the right price and served by some of the best great local beer on tap and so many exciting menu items stepped out of my regular order calzones which are unreal and had the spaghetti with marinara and italian sausage holy flavour bombs do yourself a favour pop in for a bite and a beer and catch whatever game is playing on the big screens", "a hidden gem i love how these guys make their pizza supreme pizza highly recommended", "great service and excellent food the honey garlic wings were amazing and the pizza was delicious we will be returning to this restaurant again and again", "my first visit to slice was today and we were impressed a tastefully decorated room done in dark shades a decent menu and a very friendly host waiter but the proof is in the eating and our calazones were hot and crispy stuffed with fresh vegetables and very filling highly recommended as is the short wine and beer list enough to compliment the food but not enough to turn slice into the neighbourhood sports bar", "dropped in for what i intended to be a quick slice or two of pizza i must admit the name genuinely had me expecting pizza by the slice i aimed to graband go but in all realityim not complaining what i walked into was a very nice little pizza restaraunt which offers more than just pizza i quickly decided upon a garlic calzone meal took about min to arrive dish was quite good ingredients seem fresh and of good quality server was very polite and made sure to check up on me and kept my iced tea full for my meal not too shabby if i lived nearby i would likely be back soon to delve further into their menu", "i am a fairly picky person when it comes to pizza it can not be too thick and the crust needs to be cooked enough so that the sauce does not make it soggy it also needs to have just the right amount of spice you get the idea slice pizzeria opened just last week and already it is my new favorite pizza place at the time of my visit the tvs had no service since they are still only just getting set up but the food was amazing the service was friendly the design of the place was very modernclean and they serve alcohol what more can you ask for you will end up paying a little more than you would normally pay for a pizza for a but the restaurant is definitely worth the money if they lowered their costthen i expect the quality of pizza would be no better than the quality of any other mediocre pizza in this city the only good pizzas i have had around here are over anyway if there were anything they could do to improve it would be to add a patio but their current location would not allow for that so i can not really blame them i would not want them to move because it would mean i need to travel further to go there", "i had the beef satay noodle very tasty i do t know how good their pizza is but they make great vietnamese food", "the pizza is amazing and fast the pho is great also the double whammy defs going to be coming back", "i think a new family took over so quality of the food went down i have gone there twice this month and there was hair in like everything i order and the pho tastes very artificial it had hair the noodle could not be eaten with chopticks or a fork because the were so broken up the said rolls were ripped and had hair its been like years of going to this place now i have to move on sad", "wow what a great restaurant the food is delicious and we eat here twice a week for lunch as we have our store a few blocks away everyone is hooked on the wonton soup i know that seems strange to order from a pho soup place but trust me this is unbelievably good the chicken broth is so delicious i dream about it at night i love soup in many restaurants around edmonton but this soup is the most delicious and simple the restaurant is remodeled and upscale although we only ever have takeout the staff are very friendly", "i was driving down th ave when it caught my eye the place sells pizza and vietnamese food its in a tiny strip mall right on the street the waitress was really really nice and attentive i ordered the house special pho and it was quite good she brought more tea during my meal and i asked her about the pizza thing she said the previous owner had a pizza place there and when he sold it they left the big mixer and oven so the new owners sold pizza too the decor of the place was basic with a big screen tv on the wall with sound so i could watch the news while eating ill likely go there when i am in the area just because of her price for pho on the low side and i got out of there for maybe or", "we come here everyday on break from lunch at first it seemed weird but now its the only option except mondays they are closed on mondays the interior is pretty simple and neat the news or animal planet plays on tv the staff are pretty quiet bowl is the usually favourite or if in the mood for spicy then or satay the green onion cakes are crispy and delicious the tea is always hot and available there may be better pho places but i have always liked this place enough not to bother needing to look they are also close enough to deliver if i am busy and can not take a break oven only had the pizza wings and poutine once and they were all decent but the vietnamese is better priced", "this has been my go to pho place for the last year now i go there often enough now that the owner knows me by name and always asks how i have been doing the meat is always cooked perfectly and the broth is amazing also try the green onion cakes or the dumplingsor both but you should wear sweat pants in that case never has that greasy shine to it and my lips do not feel like i put too much chapstick on my chief complaint is that when you go in with someone that orders a vermicelli bowl they push out all the pho first and leave vermicelli to about mins later but still delicious nonetheless never mind the seedy area just do not look anyone in the eyes till you get inside the restaurant", "i was a bit hesitant to get pizza here since it seems primarily like a vietnamese place but i was very pleasantly surprised it was a good hearty canadian pizza and id definitely order it again i only had a few bites of the vietnamese dishes my friends ordered though service was decent and there was plenty of parking out front", "my quest for better pho continues todays adventure brought me to the darker side of the city where pho huong mama pizza resides yes they serve pho and they serve pizzas there are only parking stalls in front of the restaurants for patrons to use and parking is scarce on the streets nearby nor do i recommend walking far in that neighbourhood at night once you are inside the first impression is okay the plasma tvs and newer style wood furnishings tell me that the place has been renovated recently the linoleum floor not so new only one gentleman working but he was quick to seat me and provided me with tea and menu the complimentary tea was hot and quite good i ordered the large pho with brisket frank tendons and tripes there is the usual assortment of condiments saracha hoisin chili oil chili sauce nice big bunch of basil a huge wedge of lime red chili pepper and a good amount of sprouts the pho came fast the bowl was steaming which is a good sign the broth was heavy with salt and may be a hint of soya not sure but i think i tasted soya which is not normal for pho broth overall not the best broth i have tasted a bit on the salty side but acceptable in a pinch the toppings were generous as is the amount of noodles even though it was for the large i thought the value was there i guess this place falls into that been there done it once nothing special moving on category would i come back may be but not until i have tried many others", "i have been coming here for a few years now and my tip from the below section still stands as true price is super reasonable there is not one other pho shop that delivers so nice if your sick and stuck in bed the service is friendly and prompt many other shops can leave your waiting on end before an order is taken great spot if you want to eat quick and cheap and have a damn good bowl of pho plus the newshockey or animal planet is always on", "stopped in here to try the highly recommended pizza by other reviewers have to agree with you guys this pizza is pretty awesome its literally the only pizza i have ordered in ages like years that came to the table and the pan was not covered in grease other places may be good too but literally you could only see tiny thin lines of cheese grease where they cut the slices the bottom of the pizza was perfectly cooked and omg crispy i mean i tapped it with a knife and was pleasantly rewarded with a good solid sound this pizza would best be described by myself as an almost chicago style deep dish type but not an actual deep dish the dough just rises that much my new favorite pizza place that is reasonably priced and close to home and i have been slowly going through them all my search may have just ended my girlfriend had the chicken vermicelli and it was pretty great as well i am pretty sure they make their own spring rolls in house because they taste fresh and vibrant not like other places that buy sysco freeze burnt garbage and serve them as their own the only thing that was a bit different was the sauce they put on the side for her dish while pretty good it was just a bit different from other vietnamese restaurants do not let the run down neighborhood fool you this place is great were definitely going back to become regulars", "loved this little ma pa shop very interesting with the pho and pizza i stuck with the vietnamese but will be planing a pizza night for sure i had beef vermicelli bowl it was delicious they even brought me extra fish sauce for it my fav hot tea was brought out during the meal which was a bonus the green onion cakes and spring rolls were top notch i spilled on my shirt and the fella brought me a wet cloth so sweet my buddy has been going for pho for years here and is a regular he swears its the best in the city i will be back", "got take out number vermicelli bowl was really good but i do not like meat balls i would rather pork or chicken steak prawn combo because it was and all i got was two bowls and green onion cakes green onion cakes unfortunately did not have the sambal olek or whatever garlic chili sauce i definitely would eat there again but maybe order different again i took it to go and did not eat it until probably hrs later so really ill have to update the review try it for yourself", "i ordered delivery the food was not terrible but salad rolls and green onion cakes both failed to have their accompanying sauces make it into the delivery and even after i specifically asked about sauces i am a sauce monster and anyone who eats salad rolls knows the peanut sauce is what ties it all together sauceless salad rolls and green onion cakes are pretty damn boring the pho was decent broth was ok it was all served well in separate containers the meat was spongy though which is a huge turn off for me sorry guys there is too much damn good vietnamese in this city and i will not be giving you a second chance", "i have been eyeing pho huong mama pizza for what seems like ages yes your eyes are not deceiving you that is the word pizza at the end of their name the times that i attempted to check them out they were closed stupid mondays yes you read that correctly they are closed mondays i did not think any vietnamese places was ever closed mondays we finally were able to check pho huong out for lunch d bone oandthree and i dropped by on a friday to celebrate the beginning of the weekend obviously we had to try out their pizza because why not the interior is pretty modern for a vietnamese restaurant the waiterowner was the only one running the show but our food came out in no time i thought the service was decent expect typical asian service but d bone insisted that i put this in my review so verbatim the service was crap his reasons no re fill of our tea pot even though we had the lid up waiter eventually came by at the end of our meal and he thought that the large bowl was not big enough perfectly justifiable complaints but i thought the food more than made up for it the menu is three pages simple and to the point pho vermicelli bowls rice plates and pizzaburgerssaladsjunk food uhh poutine this menu had me reminiscing about shanghai when they were in their old airport digs and had random non asian dishes hahaha catering to all folks guess it covers all your bases bun bo hue large their bun bo hue is terrific actually spicy full of fragrant flavour a lot of pepper is apparent at the beginning and depth this broth is legiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit yep we all ordered the i hate when everyone orders the same thing but what can ya do mamas special pizza for \u2033 pepperoni mushroom green pepper onions pineapple olives shrimps and cheese the pizza had a nice chewy crust to it and i thought there was a nice balance of cheese to topping ratio all things considered it was a pretty good pizza not the best you will ever have but way better than any pizza chain in town add pho huong mama pizza to the list of good vietnamese eats in edmonton seems like that list just keeps on getting bigger and bigger if you are looking for a delicious unique broth you need to come here pronto", "i work at macewan and have been coming here for years even when it was only known as mama pizza i have brought many coworkers to eat here for the first time and they all ask when we are going back green onion cakes pho and vermicelli bowls are the best but what is even better the owners they are so lovely and kind and remember you and what you like when you go they feel like my grandparents and i adore them prices are great with very generous portions and everyone should try it", "i was able to convince one of my friends to go on this adventure with me so we showed up at the restaurant at about pm on a weeknight bad news the place was empty we were greeted and seated in the corner before our server ran off and hid in the kitchen the restaurant itself looked small and like a typical vietnamese restaurant had sriracha hoisin sauce and other condiments available on the table the menu was mostly devoted to vietnamese noodles and soups but a whole page was dedicated to a wide variety of pizzas salads burgers and fries its the strangest thing but it apparently works for the loyal patrons of this restaurant my friend ordered the grilled pork spring roll vermicelli bowl and it was a fairly generous serving the vermicelli noodles were cooked al dente and served overtop of the usual fresh greens like lettuce cucumber and sprouts the grilled pork was moist tender and full of flavour while the spring rolls were crisp and golden things were off to a good start most of the pho offerings on the menu ranged between depending on the choice of meat and size of the bowl for myself i was craving pho with beef balls and tripe a combination that rarely exists on vietnamese menus however the restaurant was more than willing to accommodate my request so i got exactly what i wanted the bowl of noodle soup really did not look like much but the broth was fragrant with a nice depth of flavour and was served steaming although i would have liked a bit more tripe in my bowl this bowl of pho would definitely hit the spot on cold day pho huong mama pizza is a family run business and our server who i believe was the owner was very friendly and inviting the restaurant is located in an area of the city that is a little more run down but appearances can definitely be deceiving the interior of the restaurant is updated and well kept and almost seems to be out of place given its location if i were in the area and craving vietnamese i would not hesitate to drop by for a quick meal i am a little curious about the pizza who knows it could be a chance worth taking on my next visit", "ill start by saying that i have been going here for years and i will continue to do so until god forbid this place shuts down or burns down the pho is incredible i have had pho at so many places and even homemade and the soup here is delicious definitely top there was a period of time a couple years ago where i did not go into this restaurant for about eight or nine months but the day that i did i was greeted by the lovely woman who owns the place she called me by my first name and told me that she remembers me and even my typical order this is just an example at how awesome the place is the couple that owns the place are incredibly sweet and super kind they deserve all the business in the world for their awesome food and awesome attitudes if you have not already go eat here you will not regret it", "just wanted to update my review because these people are incredible i called them late one evening to ask when they were closed the lady said they closed forty minutes ago i said aww too bad i was so hungry she said well if you are close by just come i will unlock the door for you and she did i went in the restaurant over an hour after close and she was so sweet to me i got my food and left super happy she told me she does not do this for many people so i felt really special i can not stop saying good things about this place", "so what happens when half of the family wants pizza and half of the family wants asian cuisine never fear pho huong mama pizza is here i was skeptical getting take out from here because it is hard to believe that two foods go together less the pho and pizza however we thought we would give it a try and we are glad we did my oldest daughter chose the chicken vermicelli bowl i chose the spicy pho while the rest of the family went with pizza and we threw in a wonton soup because we all like that the owners seemed nice picking up the food and in general the food was really good definitely the asian food was awesome my broth for my pho was rich and flavourful you can tell it was simmering for a long time generous with the noodles and beef i was really satisfied with this dish loved the extra care they gave in packaging the bean sprouts cut up limes and thai basil wonton soup was delicious too and lots of wontons for the price my daughter really liked her dish and it looked very generous in portion pizza was okay actually most of it was really good nice chewy crust toppings that worked but we did not like how sweet the tomato sauce was however the pizza was eaten too so it could not have been that bad definitely worth checking out", "we were looking for something new so i checked on yelp and cross checked with urban spoon this place seemed all right from the reviews pho and pizza in the same restaurant in one of the worst areas of the city weird but we thought wed give it a shot we went in on a saturday afternoon at about pm and there were two old either drunk or very grumpy men sitting at one table drinking coffee another older man by himself having a beer and one younger woman just finishing her meal that was it with all the good reviews i thought it would be at least a little more busy for lunchtime on a saturday the people who were there did not even have any food in front of them one of the men drinking coffee was arguing with the owners the whole time the argument started before we entered the restaurant apparently it was all because one of the owners asked how many coffees he wanted since there were two people grumbling escalated to arguing and soon profanities and yelling from both parties ensued awkward when they finally left the owners apologized to us okay now the food the pho itself was average i have definitely had better i will admit that the atmosphere was not exactly inviting and did not allow me to fully enjoy the bowl of pho hmm this review is probably skewed and based more on happenstance that being said well stick to our regular pho restaurants", "i ordered from here a few weeks ago but i have been so busy until now the food was bomb as fck i never put something so great in my mouth so far the pizza is great the salads are great everything is great they have so many options to choose from they have pizza you never even heard of like i tried my first taco pizza i did not even know that existed it was awesome the nachos are the best thing on the menu hands down by far my favourite pizza place they have great food and they do not over charge like bps or pizza hut the food will not ever compare and i mean that in the most disrespectful way ever towards pizza hut all in all buy the pizza buy your kids the pizza buy your mama the pizza buy your dog a pizza even buy your plug a pizza everyone needs to try this amazing shit", "my favourite pizza in the city i have it at least once a week the sesame crust is delicious and i love the pepperoni mushroom or the perogy pizza", "when i moved back to the southside i was on the hunt for a new pizza place to try red swan was in my price range and i gave it a try i have ordered a few times now from red swan and honestly the pizza is good every time my only complaint may be that its pricy and i can not order in as much as id like to otherwise good pizza and orders are always on time and correct", "so i ordered one of the specials a large pizza and two pops and holy cow it was so delicious i ate the whole thing fast and free delivery the guy was really friendly too", "i have eaten pizzas so far from red swan its a small store front located next to the ho lounge do not let that stop you i picked up my order after a minute wait its not as cheap as road runner pizza but its much better quality the toppings menu is extensive the crust is nice but its the doughy kind i did not see a thin crust option but i did not ask i will order here again", "i waited over an hour for my order someone finally called and explained there was a glitch and asked if we still wanted to wait another minutes and we said we could wait we waited two more hours and then finally called and were told that they tried to deliver and we did not answer which is a lie because we literally have no missed calls from them other than the call to explain the glitch", "we ordered from here as a staff lunch highly recommend this place right from the beginning of communications they were excellent we had to have everything individually done and labeled and this was done gladly by them pizza was delivered hot and on time with a smile the selection of choices for pizza is crazy so many yummy choices and they surely delivered on taste everyone enjoyed their pizza for sure the sesame crust is a nice touch that other places do not have they also have vegan gluten free and keto options and are very reasonably priced will be ordering again", "i can not believe how many places you can get pizza around whyte avenue its staggering this red swan place is even more competition i think it opened up a month and a half ago its a small joint no eating in but they do have chairs for waiting this place sort of reminds me of road runner which is a couple blocks over their pizza is good i think its hard to mess up honestly but some places do it wrong prices seem decent but i am not factoring in the delivery fee service was good too ill go back", "there was almost no donair sauce so the donair was extremely dry and tasteless the meat was cut super thick i am talking atleast inch thick instead of the nice normal slices of meat it should have had it was honestly one of the worst donairs i have had in my life my husband threw half of his out i am not sure if it depends on who is working there or not but you can tell whomever made our donairs clearly does not take pride in their work", "found hair in the pizza a long long hair string in one of the slice so gross should have read the reviews this place needs to be shut down so gross maybe they get off on doing gross shit to peoples food", "best pizza we have had since moving to edmonton definitely recommend", "had one of their beef seekh kabab last night unfortunately my phone died the venue itself does not quite live up to the great taste you get from the kebabs as it as it is dark and dingy and gives your concerns as to the health issues around the food that they are serving however one of our favorites is their beef kebab but they need to not put so much sauce on it as it does end up dripping all the way through the paper that they kindly provide they could also shred their lettuce and julienne the onions because you do find that you get sometimes of an onion uncut", "worst donair i have ever eaten i am not the type of person to complain but i could not even eat the donair i ordered the meat was all burnt and crunchy i asked for extra sauce and did not receive it or the pop that came with my combo the pita was mush as if it had been sitting for a long time all around just gross iv had there pizza which was good but after this experience i will not be back i could do no stars i would", "this place has it all and is very well priced we have had their pizza and indian food and both are fantastic we go here often to get cheap tasty food that they know my entire family by name the staff is nice as well they have a huge selection of pizza and indian food", "do not eat from here i am pretty sure their meat was expired and i got food poisoning an hour after i ate their donair and chicken strips", "honestly i walked in and should have walked out the place is small and cluttered supplies everywhere it pretty much looks like someone who has given up and are doing this just because against better judgement i ordered a donair i mean how can you mess up on one of the dishes that is in your name ffs well i need to stop looking for the good in people because i should have listened to my little voice that told me to walk the donair wrap was stale the meat was hard and overcooked a little dry definitely not enough sweet sauce on it so note to self if you can not see the chef cooking in the kitchen when it comes to donaire or any deli style do not get it worst donaire i have ever had and i will not be going back i hope i do not get ill", "i have repeatedly ordered their samosas and they are awesome they are huge and only cents their butter chicken is great too the location itself does not look very good inside but the food has been very good all the negative reviews seem to be about donairs which i have not tried order off their indian menu next time its fantastic", "great selection of food at a good price they have a bunch of pizza combinations as well as indian dishes donair and wings i enjoy ordering from them because i can get a large variety of items compared to other pizza places do not even need to order pizza sometimes ill just pick up a couple curry dishes they also currently have free delivery no delivery fee but still tip for skip driver on skip the dishes which is why i originally gave them a try lots of vegetarian options", "terrible donair not sure how they are still in business the place was grimy af the peta was stale the cheese was cut way to thick it did not melt it just had a strange texture", "wowzers talk about st impressionson my th donair shop exterior looks clean cut enough after stepping in i very nearly stepped right back out yikes barebones tiny empty display cases boxes piled high at the end of the only seating spacea bench with seats clearlycooking is done behind the scenes not my favorite approach to donairs i almost leftbut heyim already here meh order a regular with no cheese just south of employee steps into rear maybe minutes later he reappears with my wrapped and bagged meal allright pay leave eat in car st thing that strikes me crazy thick pieces of meat about a half inch just a few big strips clearly cut right off spigot and put into meal it definitely never saw a grill thatto the best of my knowledgeis an industry no no veggies are the best part fresh and colorful saucenot bad not great pita is a lttle chewy in spots as meat is not grilled pita has likely not been steamed not pleasing to eat thick ungrilled slices all in all just not pleasing to wrap this upcuz i need to put this behind me no no i would not be happy if this were my local shop id keep on keepin on next", "something you might not know about famoso it makes for excellent take out no matter how busy they are they can have your order ready in minutes or less as long as you are ready to eat when you get home and live within minutes of a location of which there are many it is just as good as having it in the restaurant except you get to watch what you want on tv i recommend a pairing of the vesuvio with mushrooms and repeats of kitchen nightmares the sweet loaminess of the fungus accents gordon ramseys bitter disposition while the sweet basil evokes the corny ending fox staples onto every episode should you prefer gordon ramsey in hells kitchen pick up the piece order of prosciutto wrapped mozzarella while pricey it packs a wallop of flavor comprised of the simple elements the contestants constantly screw up on the show if you have an uneven number of guests award the odd ball to whomever can scream you donkey with the best gordon impression setting aside the silliness famoso offers some really robust authentically neapolitan concoctions while you should try your first bite in the restaurant their menu is a welcome and refreshing addition to my take out menu drawer", "love love love love love this place been in edmonton since november th and already have visited famoso times at different locations and i can happily say i have not been disappointed the food is awesome atmosphere is awesome and the service is wonderful if you want good pizza you have to try this place beats any fast food pizza places", "nice ambience and good food my personal favs are the bread and hummus and the tomato bisque soup pizzas are pretty good if you like neapolitan style pizza which i have seen some love and some really not like", "for a chain restaurant it was pretty decent pizza we split the margherita vesuvio soppressata with cracked chili pepper and siciliana italian sausage italian ham baked prosciutto between five of us the crust was a little soggy in the center that it was easier to eat with a knife and fork they were satisfying pizzas but not out of the ordinary", "i love this restaurant this was my first time at the south side location and it was great the restaurant itself seemed a little small and super high tables along the wall makes it awkward but the food was great and our service was awesome our appies came out quickly and our pizza was delivered just before our appies were completed south side is a little far from me but if i lived in the neighborhood id be back", "famoso in magrath has been consistently great since it opened one of my favourite places for an evening out with the girls or dinner with my hubby the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella balls are too die for the campania sauce they come in is delicious for those who do not love pizza the famoso salad is lovely and the nutella pizza is a firm favourite on girls night love the atmosphere here its a great place for sangria on the patio in the summer and lattes inside over the winter", "we love this place we frequently get take out pizza or sit in the staff is efficient and friendly and the cavoletti pizza is to die for its what we get almost every time", "i tried several pizzas at famoso the service is quick and the price is fine however i found the pizza to be lacking in ingredients it sometimes feel as though i was eating bread only moreover the pizza has to be eaten right away or it gets a bit rubbery", "ok famoso is the closest i have gotten to what you would call a guilt free pizza if there is such a thing hey do not pop my bubble with their crazy thin yet perfect crust that is low on glutten high on texture along with superb tomatoes and cheeses they are an easy choice today with spring in the air i figured id try something new instead of my usual capriccosa pizza so i went on the limb and tried their new korean bbq pork new world pizza it looked great and did have a korean bbq accent to it however it was just too sweet for my taste eating it was like having a pizza and a dessert at the same time not what i was expecting from famoso but then again who says what a fusion korean bbq pizza should taste like anyway if you are curious about it id recommend ordering half your favorite type and half this one just so you have a pizza wingman in case things do not go as planned with the korean bbq pork as for the ambiance relaxed retro modern feel with solid comfortable seating with enough space to feel you can comfortably talk without interrupting your neighbors meal background s style music helps creating an up beat yet relaxed atmosphere staff is friendly", "just like their downtown counterpart famoso offers the most authentic neopolitan pizza you can get in the city their pizzas are fire oven baked and made with import italian dough their pizza is light both soft and crispy and has low levels of gluten because of their flour resulting in a unique taste that can not be compared to other pizzas in the city the staff are very friendly and the pizzas are really quickly and its all fresh the staff can also make good wine selections to go with your pizza this is a new location and everything has been cleanly maintained there are ample amounts of cherry wood tables and booths to accommodate many people and there are tvs located around the restaurant to entertain you and your guests the restaurant is dimly lit and creates a warm and inviting atmosphere the comfy booth seats also make no better case for you to leave early the menu is similar to what you can find at the other famoso locations yet i would recommend trying the mediterranean flatbread it is an excellent appetizer the flatbread is warm and soft when you get it and the house made tzatziki and tuscan hummus dipping sauce is made to a high quality the siciliana pizza and bella pizza were a big hit as well nutella pizza pizza is a good dessert to share and adding in the extra bananas make this more unique although i prefer the downtown location this is still a great location to go to and as it is outside of the busy downtown core it is not as busy can not finish you meal do not worry take away is available with instructions on how to reheat and enjoy your leftovers", "tried out a few of their new menu items that have launched for lunch and dinner these new dishes will launch to other famosos over time currently new menu items own available at the magrath location turns out they now have a test kitchen that has helped them revamp some customer favourites all sandwiches now come with a pomodoro dipping sauce and added more main options such as a beautifully baked cheesy crusted lasagna and chicke or eggplant parmigiana in case dining guests want to order a dish other than pizza i personally love their funghi pizza the process has been streamlined so pastas come out hotter and faster it might get a bit crowded back there but they have everything worked out so that everyone has the space they need to get your food prepped and cooked interestingly the gluten free flour they use is from italy for diners that are glutenfree or gluten sensitive also desserts the desserts they have are just what we remembered but better davincigelato in stalbert now makes supplies the gelato and makes the tiramisu using famosos own recipe if you are feeling up to it order the oven roasted bananas with caramel and crushed pecans with gelato so simple but delicious", "great atmosphere good food my family can enjoy it or i can go with friends and have alot of fun", "i have never been disappointed with famoso the food is always delicious and is ready pretty quick their drinks are a decent price especially at happy hour and there is lots of different cocktailswinesbeer to choose from any location i have been to is clean and well kept and has not been overly busy for me famoso is always a great choice for dinner drinks with friends or just to grab some gelato", "this place is exactly what we want when we go out to treat ourselves me and my husband went here a few days ago and we had excellent service delicious food and we even got free dessertjust because it was such a nice surprise the managerowner clearly knows how to bring people in again we would definitely go here again and again and recommend famoso for yummy food great atmosphere and good prices", "i ordered the primavera pizza today because i was visiting my mother and the restaurant is very close to her condo upon my arrival the server said it was nearly ready and by the time i paid for it they brought the order out i was please to be told that there is a discount sorry but i do not recall if the discount was because i picked the order up or because it was noon or perhaps it was a coronavirus special whatever the reason it was just with tax i liked the selection of pizzas at formosa because they are very unique compared to other pizza places be forewarned that the olives used on this pizza are very salty those olives while being tasty made the pizza very salty which my mother did not care for i enjoyed it this is not you fathers thick crust smothered in cheese pizza this is a more refined style pizza and i enjoyed it although it was probably saltier than i would have liked too if you like thin crust pizzas that are a little different then this is the place for you this location is just south of rd ave nw in the same strip mall as save on foods", "have you tried the nutella mocha its so yummy i could not get enough of this mocha when my girlfriend introduce me to it today its a great way to end the night when its so cold outside this is better than normal hot chocolate and normal coffees definitely come back and try it again with some flatbread for not bad for a drink service was good as always staff were friendly and its super quiet when you come around pm on a weekday", "service is so so but the food is consistently great love the roasted tomato soup the pizza is thin crust and made from scratch when you order menu has a variety of classic and fun pizza flavours iespecially enjoy the pear and gorgonzola definitely worth checking out", "used to order from here almost once a week even after we moved to a different neighbourhood we went back to this location because the closer one was bad never again they have not gotten even one of our orders right in the last five times we have taken to asking for a manager just to place an order because the staff that answers the phone was always getting it wrong usually minor things but in the past two months they have fed me meat in my strictly vegetarian order three times were horrible about trying to resolve the situation too said they would deliver it but did not know how long it would take did not want to give me a refund only store credit will literally never eat there again and we were one of their most loyal customers i even told them how seriously ill i could get as a result of eating meat they could not care less worst location ever", "i always choose this boston pizza now for pick up as its the most consistent with the food quality it does not burn my pizza and the service has always been good today i picked up my pizza and when i got home realized two of the toppings were missing i called right away and told them about it and asked if they could deliver as i did not want to run back there again without question he said he would send out another pizza and delivery would be about an hr the pizza arrived fresh and with all the toppings on time i showed him the other one to confirm and he let me keep both by far the best customer service i have had from any boston pizza with no hassle thanks", "what only two stars for the premier started in edmonton franchise pizza joint how dare i boston pizza has ok mid price range food it is not fancy it is consistent everywhere you go though and today was no different however the place were the restaurant can excel is in service this is what i did not get today two of us arrived during the lunch rush today and got the last available table we were waiting for our third person to join us she was just about ten minutes behind us this should not be a problem we can get our drinks chat and peruse the menu after sitting there for about ten minutes the server shows up with the food we did not order and says you guys have not ordered yet have you we said no we have not he said i will be right back and took the mystery food back to the kitchen our third party arrived and our server once again shows up to take our order almost minutes and i can now order a glass of water we ordered our food too i ordered an individual meat overload slightly less than twenty minutes later our food arrived and my chicken pesto pizza was placed in front of me my comment was what is this it is not what i ordered his reply it is the chicken pesto pizza you ordered i said no i ordered the meat overload he quickly disappeared into the kitchen and came back to tell me they would make me one right away in the mean time i told the others to go ahead and eat just under minutes later my food finally arrived the server seemed to think that touching me on the shoulder every time he came back to the table would be his apology did a manager check to make sure everything was ok nope did they offer to discount my meal nope did they take my pop off the bill nope did they take my money without a smile or a have a nice day yup now i did not want a discount i did not want free pop or dessert i just wanted to be acknowledged for the inconvenience serving tables is not easy and good servers deserve a lot of credit for what they do but please remember without a customer there will not be any servers", "well i am going to up my stars for this boston pizza although its still not my favorite bps in the city its pretty good the server we got this time was cute and bubbly she even made a joke about my boyfriends dad being messy he did not catch it but we both laughed so she got extra points for that she was a great server we were not left sitting with dirty plates for very long she did forget my boyfriends coffee though she brought him an empty mug and then left it was a little weird she filled it up when we reminded her though the food was good as always i love how big their starter salads are they could meal in themselves if you have not ever tried the spinach salad try it its delicious", "let me start by saying that i am not a fan of boston pizza i have not been in years mostly just due to their lazy predictable food and poor beer selection however when the heck did they figure out how to do wings they actually have a wide selection including new flavors such as asian spice and chipotle bbq you also get the option of either baked or breaded and fried with each flavor i usually avoid boston pizza however for a late night snack id now to be willing to give their wings a try", "we came here after an evening of skating the resteraunt side was not busy at all as it was a little later the manager indie was our server which i thought was neat as you do not see alot of managers serving their customers hes fantastic always made sure we had refills friendly he made the experience great we got a medium pizza half deluxe the other half rustic italian i love the rustic italian pizza from here little spicy but so tasty and then we also got cactus cuts which are delicious also", "went there yesterday and was very disappointed i have been to many bps around town so i expected better we went to the lounge and provided that it was not too busy in either the lounge or the dining area we thought we would get our food at a decent time we ordered our drinks and we could see our waitress making the drinks and before she gave it to us she was helping out othersand she would go behind the bar counter and apply eye drops scratch her face her noseit was very disturbing we got our drinks and were ready to order but the waitress walked away and did not ask us until we had to flag her down i would understand if it was a busy night but it was not i asked her how long we would get our food she said the kitchen is backed up we paid for our drinks and left and definitely not coming back to this location it was gross seeing the waitress scratch her nose apply eye drops and then serve us and other guests without hand washing by the looks of it not many of the other guests were impressed either i was lucky to have carried hand sanitizer with me", "an updateive ordered from this location a couple of times recently typically i order lasagna i admit i am biased i like to see it a bit browned for appearance and i also like it to arrive very hot i specify this when i order yes i order my lasagna well done lately its been arriving luke warm and not well done as well as taking awhile but i am a loyal customer and i normally love bp so i have not given up yet stay tuned", "good bp for take out or eat in its big and spacious i get the boston royale and order the onions extra crispy they do a good job of that its centrally located with lots of parking and a shopping center in the same parking lot making it convenient for dinner and errands", "as someone with multiple allergies consistency is important to me when i go out to eat consistency in food prep and consistency in the venue itself as major changes can greatly affect not just my dining experience but my overall health i have had nothing but wonderful experiences at this boston pizza location and consider it to be one of the best in the city service is generally fast even with some of my special order requests and the management is great about working the floor to ensure customers are happy you can tell they actually care and that shows in the rest of the restaurant", "fantastic service great food would come here again been to quite a few bps but this one is quite amazing as the others are food is presented well could not complain about anything ps try the french onion soup d", "great day to pop into bps did not realize the oilers were playing so that was an added bonus to our wonderful food and service we ordered the tuscan pizza and found out you can do half periogy pizza and half hawaiian you can half almost any pizza except thin crust we were told and beers and a peach margarita hands down all our food and drinks were hits the place was pretty steady but superb service and food", "i only give stars and that is for the staff only most of them are great friendly and welcoming indie the manager is absolutely fantastic i would give stars if it was based on staff alone the food is not good at all its the most local bar lounge to us so we have given it a go a few times and i have never enjoyed a meal and i am in no way fussy the bar is open and feels cold also at the bar counter there is an awful smell at times we have sat there a couple times sometimes the dishwasher soap they use can be tasted off the glass there are lots of improvements to be made i have not gone back in months even though it is out nearest local i have let my partner go alone as i just can not stand that smell at the counter and it is the only good place to sit as you can have interaction with the nice staff there overall disappointing", "boston pizza is always awesome and always delicious tonight i shared a caesar salad with my wife and then ate a pepperoni pizza service was very good and professional and fast as well seating is limited due to covid but its still possible to enjoy the restaurant and foods boston pizza is also a great place to meet friends wether you are eating at the restaurant side or the bar lounge", "really good pizza but with way too expensivegreat customer service and i love how its very very close near my work i wish the prices were less than they are but unfortunately with our economy they have to be skyhigh", "they have a great take out special for medium you can pick any pizza off menu love their crust", "awesome pizza had this in saskatoon when passing thru a few years ago this place has some pretty cool unique pizzas you do not see any place else i had the spiciest pizza and a rider pizza today walk in special good prices think crust and tasty", "okay so my feelings on all hours is very mixed on one hand they are fairly pricey phone orders are always rushed online orders seldom work hour or more delivery times i once received a regular poutine instead of the donair poutine i ordered and once i had an order cancelled by the restaurant due to lack of delivery drivers even though i was more than willing to wait i have also experienced extreme sass from a delivery driver who could not find my apartment despite having made no attempts to call and ask for help which i would have found very reasonable i do not have these problems with dominos on the other hand accessible hours actual city wide delivery and the food has always been delicious so its a relatively decent trade off", "i have ordered from this place like five times now and wow its amazing like i have never ever had a single complaint the pizzas topping are always great and plentiful i have never ever felt the need to ask for extra cheese which is rare there wings are crispy and amazing the donair are awesome this is where you go to get good cheap pizza in edmonton so good", "ordered at am a order of pizza wings whatever waited over an hour and called them they said driver should be right here hours in still no food called to talk again and spoke to confused employees they said they would send it and it would be hour and they would give me off hours and off no thanks canceled my order and ordered elsewhere min later someone calls and says they are here i told him we canceled because over hours is ridiculous and he obviously had wrong address because no ones at my door ridiculous", "wow hungry in the middle of the night and want some pizza after eating here the following words come to mind fast abstain deny oneself diet famish forbear go hungry not eat refrain and starve thanks thesauruscom i was desperate not expecting great pizza but i was expecting to have pizza left over i threw it out it was undercooked in a room temperature deepfryer with a dashed scattering of cheese and a hint of tomato paste i regretted ordering for of us changed their mind upon appearance and as hungry as i was only stomached slices i hate wasting food but i did not regret banishing this soggy mess from my house in a sealed bag not good for kids groups wallets tastebuds colon tracts hunger good for a laugh gas a reason to sit on the toilet without taking laxatives decent service", "i seriously wish i could make a million reviews because this pizza place is off the chain", "am on a long weekend nightshift where to get pizza turns out here till am no problem for downtown delivery if an hour wait does not bother you maybe we got lucky but our pizza veg greek was a ok", "yo they came thru wit the jumbo donair and it was jumbo i can not even finish also when they say they will be an hour they will be exactly an hour if they sooner they will be there quick always on time always coming thru wit da sweet sauce are not that sweet", "this is your go to place when you are craving pizza at am and all the other late night pizza joints are closed or not taking orders pizza papa johns panago the pizza is average and will taste pretty good if you have already had many drinks and this may be why you are ordering at am if you order at this time and call back around am to see if it is coming no one may answer in our case the pizza arrived fine at am and was fairly decent with a fair amount of toppings and more than average amount of cheese the price however was steep for for pizzas but i guess for this late at night you can expect to pay a premium overall good for late night choices and i would do again if other options were already closed", "giving this place even one star pains me as does the slice and a half i just ate which appears to be debating about whether or not it should stay in my stomach or jump ship and find a new home in my toilet hands downthe absolute worst pizza i have ever had in this city ill be calling the health board tomorrow that is of courseif i survive the night", "my boyfriend and i had ordered delivery from here on two separate occasions and both times the food came hot so that was nice surprise we both loved the donairs and the lasagna in the donair the onions and tomatoes were fresh and there was just the right amount of meat and sauce the lasagna had a little more sauce that id have liked but nonetheless the flavouring was really good the pasta was tender and the cheese on top was perfectly melted the burgers on the other hand were okay at best they tasted like the ones you would find in a grocery freezer nothing special", "the worst service ever we ordered pizza to our hotel fantasyland where this company distributes flyers every evening under your door we called ordered no problem until the driver called looking for directions i mean come on you placed a flyer under my door and you do not know where the fantasyland hotel is after giving directions our pizza finally arrived an hour late to appease us the driver would give us or off what you can not make up your mind how much you are going to give us off for being late whatever you do do not order from this place",

rip off artists big time", "just had the pizza here for the first time tonight was blown away by the amount of toppings and cheese will be returning", "i have never had an issue with this place until last night i usually always order here after i am home from being out for the night as its open late however last night was absolutely ridiculous i had ordered here at am and it took them hours to get my food here and they did not even give me my complete order i feel as if i should not have been required to pay however when he called his boss he said i had to pay at least dollars for such poor quality service do yourself a favour all hours donair and pizza and hire a competent driver perhaps get some competence yourself as owners and learn the true way of how to deal with an angry customer as the customer is always right i will never order here again", "bunch of ass holes terrible customer service refuse to admit a mistake do not go here nasty rotting foul smelling food they make threats to paying customers call back and say they have our address wtf", "it was so so pizza but this one night my brother called to order pizza after work he has a stuttering problem the phone

called asking about our order again they said nobody called with that order nobody know you like lady i am looking at the confirmation email my boyfriend hung up on them and i called them back some fifteen year old kid answered acting like the manager he told me i was wrong that he was the manager and that he never received an email from me repeating every word on the confirmation email the kid said we neva got you orda and i asked his age he said when he obviously was in his teens determined to get my order i called back again an actual adult answered i told him everything that was going on

it has been minutes since i last called and a half hours since i ordered incompetent assholes", "disgusting between customer service and their prices honestly happy with this place for years between service and on demand until today they called my husband a fucking stupid customer when i called to let them know the order was wrong when the delivery guy showed up he told me to never call them again which i will oblige this has been the worst customer service i have ever received on friday june i feel ashamed for the business to have ever talked back so rudely and hang up on a customer i my whole entire life and again food is not always up to quality never in the time frame they choose have gladly waited and hour because i like the place and delivery people today i have been blind sided never in my life have i taken more offence to anything i do not wish for anyone in any situation to feel this down about what another has bullied upon them buy from franchises that are structured on their customer service prices and making others happy", "horrible horrible horrible took an hour and a half to even get here called and asked when it would be here called and canceled while i was talking to them they hung up not impressed will never order from here again horrible service", "my boyfriend i always order this when we want cheap late night food portions are good pizza is good but the hot wings are the absolute best in the city food is always hot when it arrives do not enjoy the donairs they are a bit dry but other than that its pretty good they have great combo deals aswell

up in the microwave i called them to say this again tonight and they put me on hold after i told them i was unsatisfied yet again and i can hear them laughing in the background i had mentioned the previous times when i ordered the guy said hot do you expect it burnt i said hot enough that i can take a bite and it will almost burn my mouth from being cooked properly so i go to check the wings and they are stone cold to the touch i call back to say i want a refund and the guy starts swearing at me and yelling avoid this place for delivery they have no idea what customer service be is about at all they are absolutely rude to women they charge way higher than anywhere else and are abusive be careful", "just all around crappy food \u200d pizza too doughy not enough sauce wings burnt

from this sketchy place totally sketch i was watching my aunts house waited about hours finally pizza man comes calls me and asked me to come outside to his car and get the pizza he did not even come to the door me and my brother witnessed this the food is not that good but what do you expect for a place open all night", "the only pizza we order the are open very late which is great on those fuzzy late nights i have never had any issues with their delivery service during regular hours the delivery service is fast and great if you order food very late at night use your common sense it will take a while to get to your door they do deliver city wide also take that into consideration if you do not have any patience to wait go pick it up its that simple overall their pizzas always loaded i mean loaded with toppings these guys have the best donair and all meats pizza and i hate all meats pizza hahaha the best pizza in town hands down", "ordered the paneer pizza and the khazana special to take out lots of well prepared toppings on both pizzas and a decent amount of cheese the khazana special though quite tasty had a slight flavour of pork that was a bit freezer burned not sure if this was the bacon or the pepperoni my wife who is usually sensitive to these things did not comment on it and it was slight but to me noticeable still quit tasty regardless i really liked the flavour of the paneer pizza fresh and vibrant flavours and even tasted the paneer in the mix of vegetables i found the crust a little on the chewy side though my wife thought it was okay a small container of what i believe to be a yogurt or ranch based creamy sauce supplied with each pizza was a nice touch the pizza overall is a step above the chain pizza places with some unique toppings would like to try the palak paneer pizza next time using the for special saves a bit of money and allows you to try different flavours", "i have been india and i dislike the food we wanted to try this place because they had america canadian pizza on the menu meat lovers pizza and it was amazing we only ordered the chicken wings they were awesome and i loved the east indian salad served with it they served taco chips and sauce but it was east indian the kids loved it all we loved it all and now we have to go back to try more of the east indian food the server was komal but she seemed to be working in the kitchen as well great place great food great atmosphere thanks a lot", "i never take the time to write reviews but for sepps pizza its worth the time i am very picky about pizza crispy quality cheese will not step foot in a pizza kind of picky and sepps ticks all of the boxes i have ordered the emilia pizza twice now and its the best pizza i have had in the city previous favorite was paninis the crust is thin and flavorful the meat sauce is perfectly balanced and not overly meaty or salty the cheese to sauce ratio is awesome and the finish of freshly micrograted parmesan really takes it to the next level picked up the pizza and it was ready right in time hot and fresh in regards to pricing for a pizza for is a competitive price for the quality you get compared to any other pizza joint in town next time i order and there will be a next time ill update with a picture of the beautiful presentation", "tried this out tonight tasty and large portion nice to have good veggie options dough and sauce were great definitely will order again and try the other flavours", "here is the scoop from this guys perspective the pizza was ok i wanted it to be amazing since i drove more than halfway across the city to pick it up we ordered the camrose roni and the pacific the pacific was my main choice as i love smoked salmon this was going to be which includes cans of san pellegrino and a tip along with the two pizzas well we get there and are told that because of some salmonella outbreak in the us there were no red onions on the pacific well anyone who is had a smoked salmon sandwich knows that red onions are an integral part of the flavour a couple of things about this really aggravated me first why do not you go get some locally grown red onions its julyyou can get red onions locally second and i am not trying to be that guy about it but i added a tip because restaurant folks work hard and i appreciate that but they could have phoned and told me that of the toppings on the pizza were not going to be on the pizza and at least give me a chance to change my order that was kind of shitty so probably will not be back because of it the camrose roni was pretty good but i was pretty soured by the expert this having said all this if you are in the neighbourhood and you like ny style pizza that may or may not have all the toppings listed you can not go wrong with sepps", "while the pizza that sepps turns out is good its also wildly overpriced hipsters do not seem to mind that too much but i most certainly do prices need to come down to reflect the value of what is on offer", "extremely overpriced for what you get ordered a margherita received it without the basil gave them feedback on instagram without a response they also keep paying food bloggers to promote their crap pizza pizza itself was ok id rather order from cosmic pizza or even pizza hut", "we have had sepps on a few different occasions now and it never disappoints the crust is classic ny style and they have some classics as well as some original creations would highly recommend", "classic pizza restaurant the menu is very specific with a variety of pizza options the crust is very thin and delicious the problem is that a thin crust has to avoid juicy toppings the vegan pizza had some veggies that made the pizza a little bit soggy in certain spots however overall the pizza is delicious i also think it could be a smart idea to add some kalamata olives the olives would add some small acidity and flavor the prices are decent and the portions are also good sepps does not have any appetizers though so be aware of that definitely recommended", "i wanted to love this pizza so badly and in a way i did but it just did not live up to its well reviews on other platforms we ordered on a saturday night picked it up on time and it was on our table and served within minutes of doing so but it was lukewarm and did not taste all that fresh it was missing parsley and we almost were not even sure if it was the pizza we ordered the flavour of the sauce was great we got the emilia i think but again it simply did not seem fresh crust was a little tough i must echo the sentiments of others who were not impressed not worth the price despite such a dismal review i will be trying them again because i love new york style pizza its not like it tasted bad it was good just not anything great at the end of the day i am pretty easy to please and will eatenjoy most anything id say give it a try if you are as forgiving as myself or order with lower expectations lol", "thought wed try this new pizza place just because its close to our doctors office and we had to stop there later in the day on a friday we ordered regular pizzas online and the confirmation process was a bit confusing i received an email saying that the restaurant had received my order then another saying it had been accepted i was expecting another email giving me an estimated time for pick up but did not receive one i placed our order at pm i headed over to the place after my appointment about pm and the restaurant itself was very clean and the staff were very friendly there were no other customers in the restaurant she told me it would be another minutes which was fine i waited and she brought the pizzas out to me when they were ready both pizzas were just okay the cheese was crispy which was nice and a bit different than other places the crust was cooked well a decent amount of toppings on the pizza and flavor was okay we had it we ate it but well probably stick to our other favorites overall a clean location friendly staff and just okay pizza", "thought wed try this new pizza place today and ordered the deluxe we found it overcooked with very little cheese on it it was quite dry and did not seem to have the required tomato sauce or cheese to make it moist at all the chicken wings were deep fried but not bad for flavourwe ordered the salt and pepper oneseverything seemed to be overcookeddont know if well give it another try", "love this place family run business and the owner is so friendly and personable we got our pizza delivered in minutes hot and fresh crust sauce are delicious and they are not skimpy on the toppings nitzas used to be the best place in town but i can easily say this place is ten times better", "best authentic italian pizza you will ever have the owners john and angela are the nicest and funniest people you will know and very well respected john is known as mr pizza man in the neighbourhood great for deals homemade lasagna pasta and doners with their homemade secret sauce i especially loved the atmosphere you feel like you are walking into an italian guys home with posters of his favourite italian soccer teams italy flags and photos of his family back home from the village a must eat this place will not disappoint", "my wife and are addicted to red swan pizza unique flavours fast friendly service awesome delivery i have not yet picked my favourite pizza the prices are very good", "what in the sweet mother sherwood park does not need more pizza joints or so i thought they keep popping up and i did not think we needed more tonight i decided to roll the dice on the new guy red swan pizza well let me tell you the old guard better watch out we got the philly steak pizza and it might have been one of the best pizzas i have ever had it was exactly like a philly cheese steak the sauce was amazing the meat was crispy the veg was cooked perfectly and somehow the crust was fluffy and crispy perfectioned defined as a gourmet pizza for sure we also got the meat pizza which was really good but paled in comparison to the philly we also tried the bacon cheese bread and it was awesome my kids loved it i am torn on the fact that they cut their pizza in squares i am more of a triangle guy not toself next time ask for triangles and see what happens will definitelybe getting from there again and you should too", "after all the reviews i decided to try this pizza out it was lacking toppings and flavour and they forgot my dip i paid for i would never order again first time customer very dissatisfied", "tried the perogy and a spicy chicken pizza it was tasty thought the prices were a little high for what you get but flavour was good would try again", "stopped last night coming home from vacation gave them a try good pizza tasted fresh decent prices", "we have come here to pick up a few times and have never been disappointed their lemon garlic shrimp pizza is one of my favourites there is something for everyone as well so if your feeling something more traditional you can order pepperoni or canadian classic but if your feeling more adventurous there are pizzas to choose from if you are from sherwood park or even stopping through on the way home you should give red swan a try", "this place does not have very good reviews so ill be kinder to them ordered through skip the dishes order came hot exactly how i ordered it i am normally turned off by any restaurant with the words all hours or hours because you never know what is going down in those places i will say the salt n pepper wings were awesome crunchy seasoned properly but they did not give a free dip which should always be included pizza was fine and the vegetable samosas were also good", "stay away super sketchy drivers he tryed to make me get in his car and go to the bank for cash because his machine was not working also my husband son and i both got food poisoning", "really unimpressed with the quality of food and customer service i found a staple in my caesar salad and called to make sure they through out the remainder of the ingredients used he simply just told me to remove it and enjoy this is unacceptable and someone could be hurt as they clearly do not care about the standard of food they serve", "was at a party last night and we called them quite late am the first person that spoke with them were told were closed goodbye and then they hung up without the caller even speaking i grabbed the phone to call myself first thing they said was i already told you were closed the thing about this that is irritating however is that i was trying to ask what time the kitchen is closed since their website lists their operating hours as am am and they are telling us we can not make an order the person was incredibly rude interrupted me and would not even let me ask the one question and then hung up on me so i still do not know what time to not bother calling for pizza if i was ever going to buy from them again which i am never going to order there again anyway due to absolutely terrible customer service as someone who works in the customer service industry this was an incredibly infuriating phone call i get it if there is only mins left there is not much room to accommodate customers but if you can not help them you tell them i am sorry the kitchen is closed now and we are not doing anymore deliveries for the day you do not hang up on a customer and treat them so rudely", "i ordered one of the value combos and when i received it i was missing my wings i rushed outside and told the delivery driver and he told me to call them and they would sort it out no big deal so i phoned and explained what happened and he said he would talk to the driver and phone me back i waited minutes and no one had called me back so i phoned them and explained once again they said ok well send out a new batch and then hung up on me when i finally got my wings they were a funny color and i was afraid to eat them i would not recommend", "worst service ever we found the flyer under our hotel room door and assumed the service was endorsed by our hotel after minutes of not receiving the order we have called the place to ask for it the person answering the phone said the driver was on his way and hang up called again after one hour with the same result one hour and fifteen minutes later the driver showed up and was going to charge us more than the advertised price given that we were never told a price on the phone aside from the flyer in the room we declined the pizza it turns out that the hotel does not sanction this pizza place and has been trying to stop them from placing flyers in the room it might have been not a big deal had the guy not been rude on the phone each time", "worst foodservice i have ever experienced in my life the guy on the phone was being completely disrespectful towards my friend and then on top of that we waitedp hours for our food and then as we got the call from the driver that he has arrived he was not actually there so he got us to meet him at the local gas station which i did not know was a thing with delivery when we arrived at the station the man was stumbling and dropping his money and could not even talk to us do not i beg of you do not order from this place", "i had bad experiences there the first one was a rude employee i remember walking into the shop and he just looked at me and said what do you want how rude the nd time was a am visit and i guess they did not have any fresh donair meat because he microwaved my donair right in front of me i was like wtf i understand its am but still this is all hours pizza come on man on top of that the pita bread was crunchy yes crunchy thus stale then he charges me for the small donair strikes and you are out in my books not going back there again even if it is the only thing open at that hour", "wow what a joke absolutely the worst do not order order from anywhere else seriously told me hr waited over minutes called them to tell them i do not want it anymore as i walked to the food court to grab something else as i was starving i already thought hr would be a long time to wait then the manager has the nerve to get on the phone with me and try to tell me his side of the story excuse me your side of the story should have been apologizing up and down for the long wait but no its because his driver had like other drop offs and we always say hr hire more drivers or do not do delivery absolutely ridiculous", "yes would recommend the place is super small to dine in but i still loved it nice atmosphere relaxing music staff were super friendly i had the lunch combo b butter chicken it was way too much food butter chicken rice lentils vegetables salad and yogurt stuff i can not stress enough how tasty the food is haha the butter chicken was my least favorite the dal khazana is to die for fresh naan and a chai to round out my meal i am a happy camper takeout from here is awesome as well", "food was great and filling the service was awesome as well id definitely go back the chili chicken was not as good as i have had st jaber places but it was still really good", "i have always heard rave reviews about khazana and had it on my list of places i wanted to make my way to eventually especially since my office is a quick walk from the downtown location alas currently i am working from home and downtown is currently a bit of a trek for me fortunately khazana indian express is close to my home and was the perfect alternative we ordered the butter chicken because we were having a craving and of course you can not order butter chicken without naan so we ordered some of that as well we took a shot on the tandoori salmon as we wanted to add another dish but did not necessarily want another curry and wanted a different protein all of the above was delicious the naan tasted like it had just come out of a fire roasted oven and had that extra smoky flavour which i thought really made it next level we had the garlic naan there were a couple options but was not feeling like the regular naan the garlic naan was delicious next time i am at khazana i will definitely get the garlic naan again the butter chicken had a generous amount of chicken and was perfectly spiced the salmon was the spicier of the dishes but i did not mind it at all it cleared out my sinuses and i love that feeling when eating spicy food it was a beautiful bright and colorful red from the tandoori spices i imagine it also had a bit of a smoky flavour and the fish was perfect flaky and tender inside fish i find generally has a very fine line between done and overcooked and this was perfect", "wow this little restaurant in windermere really took me by surprise the portions are so generous and food is bomb i always order the butter chicken palak paneer and naan bread it is so yummy the restaurant is available on skip but i enjoy dining in as well it has classy decor and feels intimate staff are friendly too i highly recommend", "i have wanted to try sepps pizza for the longest time and finally i had time to drive the hour into town and pick up a pie we went with the apulo with pineapple we arrived pretty early so we waited in our vehicle for the text to let us know we could come in and grab our pizza this place was seriously busy every two minutes people were pulling up to grab pizza it was very covid safe only one in at a time finally it was our turn the flavour of the pizza was amazing i found the crust a little to thick for my liking but was still enjoyable i would definitely come back again", "excellent crust i could have made a meal from just the crust lol overall we were very happy with out first order from sepps will be back and am looking forward to exploring the remainder of the menu", "sepps porco fungi pizza mozzarella cheese house made fennel sausage mushrooms and red peppers sepps pizza avenue i went to italy back in it was a life changing experience before then i had not travelled much school insufficient funds parental tyranny and insecurity consumed my life resulting in the waste of my s i decided to take charge of my s i travelled to victoria to see dj premier i went to a music festival in new york to see a tribe called quest and i spent my honeymoon in italy italy was a bucket list item for me the pantheon duomo colosseum and uffizi gallery were all selling points for my trip but it was the food that excited me the most especially the pizza after eating pizza in italy things were never the same i began to despise the dumps like pizza pizza hut and panago for bastardizing italys godly creation i also found myself on an arduous journey unable to find something local that measured up to italys pizza tonys pizza palace our divine ruler of italian cuisine comes close to matching the best of rome however their hardened crust has an undesirable crunch to it buco impersonates the lightness and almost captures the taste of italian pizza however their charred pies have poor structural integrity resulting in all the ingredients swiftly falling off as you pick up a slice my journey to find a local equivalent for the pizzas i devoured in italy has been painful and unsuccessful at times i feel like martin sheen in apocalypse now searching for my colonel kurtz after about two years i finally found my colonel kurtz at sepps pizza i told myself months ago that ill never find anything local that measured up to the pizza in rome but i found it yesterday sepps operates solely as a take out and delivery joint next to their order window are scattered photographs of pop culture icons including james dean elvis presley and clint eastwood the joint describes its pizza as new york style with a northern twist however one bite of this pie brought back memories of rome including the spanish steps and the dario argento museum everything about this pizza was fantastic the mozzarella and red peppers were fresh and delicious the generous distribution of large mushrooms my second favourite pizza topping complemented the piquant fennel sausage and the dough maintained its structural composure as i viciously mangled it with my gnarled hands i also appreciated the thinness of the pie which mimicked some of the pizzas i had in rome although i have heard some great things about high dough and their detroit style product i have become partial to the thinner crust it allows the toppings to shine and does not make you feel like a fat piece of crap after eating it after finishing the entirety of the pie i still felt light and i was food coma free as a result i decided to frolic in the playground and enjoyed me some little kid slides bringing back memories of my s childhood and encouraging me to come home and watch are you afraid of the dark my favourite s show my rating", "this pizza is amazing we ordered the pizza with sopprasetta and it did not disappoint id definitely recommend giving sepps a try", "wow amazing nyc style pizza definitely our favourite spot in yeg right now they have a super easy to use online app for pick upwe prefer pick up as we want to make sure small businesses can keep as much of their profit as possible in these difficult times so far every pizza we have tried has been delicious but my favourite is the the canadian sepps way think an elevated hawaiian pizza and the crispy apicus the crust is perfect and the ingredients are always fresh they are also on your favourite food delivery apps check it out", "pizzas amazing service is the worst they only accept orders through their app which often does not work and if its not working you are out of luck they will not take an order over the phone our app is the only way to order but our app can not be used to order sorry", "this pizza is garbage that is all i need to say do not waste your money here they do not know how to make pizza at all", "we finally decided to stop by for a pizza from this small new place on our way home and we were so glad we did they have quite a few pizzas to choose from at times you just have to go for the basic one and this is what we did bacon mushroom alfredo the dough was delicious light and crispy alfredo sauce fresh mushrooms red onions and bacon all covered with cheese and baked to perfection we are impressed and we will definitely come back for more support the local small businesses shop local dine local", "stopped by here late today to try the pizza its actually pretty good the owners were nice will come back", "i really like supporting this business its family owned in our neighbourhood the owner is a great guy and the pizza are not half bad either heather and i disagree on the crust i am a fan because i find greasy crust think pizza hut disgusting heather finds the crust here too dense and dry it reminds me of the homemade pizza crust my mom made when i was a kid the toppings are plentiful and fresh and the sauce is good not great delivery is always faster than quoted which is great its not pizza i would necessarily rave about but its always solid and i love supporting the local little guy the friendly service boosts a star pizza to a star rating give them a try", "i really do not like giving bad reviews but i have to in this instance so that others can make their decision armed with opposing views having never had it before my boyfriend and i ordered pizza from pisa pizza because of the great reviews on yelp we ordered two kinds greek and meat lovers the greek pizza was not goodat all the crust was very thick but more like bread stale bread than a good pizza crust the meat lovers was only slightly better but not that good either almost tasteless the pizzas arrived almost cold and had to be heated up in the microwave i would have to say that this is one of the worst pizzas either of us have ever hadand we eat pizza often from various pizza joints i do not know if they were having an off nightthe delivery guy said they were really busy but i honestly can say i will never order pizza from here again sorry", "owner is exceptionally friendly and conversational always glad to stop and chat for a bit before i leave as for the food the crust is light and soft inside and crispy on the outside likely the best i have ever had the sauce has a nice subtle sweet taste to it i very much like cheese is fresh and tasty and meatveggies are fresh and used in ample amounts this is my favourite pizza place now ever", "the pizza here was fresh and very tasty i called ahead an ordered and it was ready to be picked up within minutes definitely will order from them again", "high quality pizza for reasonable prices the staff are very knowledgeable and friendly great variety to their menu", "with names like spolumbo sausage spudizza and constant gardener how could these pizzas not be interesting pizzeria prego is well worth the visit there was a point in my life where i thought that i had developed a gluten allergy woe is me it was only the flu and i went here to get drum roll please gluten free pizza it actually tastes pretty much the same as a regular pizza i have even ordered it since i found out my gluten allergy was nonexistent calling all celiacs and gluten allergys this is the place to go if you have a hankering for pizza even if you do not have a problem with gluten this pizza place has something for everyone my boyfriend is especially fond of the mashed potato pizza spudizza and my favorite is the spinach feta and mushroom spinochio the prices are pretty decent but the hours kind of suck they are closed mondays tuesday through saturday they are open am pm and sundays they are open from pm pm they do have free delivery but only in a limited area other wise there is a surcharge check them out on line at wwwpregopizzacom now go get yourself some weird and delicious pizza", "i have only been here once and will give it another try but i was not overly impressed now do not get me wrong the food was not bad just average i loved the pizza sauce they use and the variations of pizza they make spinnichio was really good not a fan of their crustpizza dough though also i would not recommend the breadsticks way to much saltseasoning on it until i give this place another shot it will be just average but worth checking out", "crappy boring pizza expensive prices and a minute wait when i was told it would be minutes i will not go back not happy at all first time i ever threw out leftover pizza instead of demolishing it the next moring", "crappy boring pizza expensive prices and a minute wait when i was told it would be minutes i will not go back not happy at all", "i just had a cheese pizza the service was friendly and quick and the pizza was good i prefer this over some big chain restaurant its cozy", "this place is alright the toppings on our pizza were kind of cold so that was a bummer unlike most other pizza places the pizza here was not very greasy which was a nice change they have a good selection of pizzas as well they are pretty big on having gluten free pizza which for many people might be a selling point but i am not bothered either way other than that i did not find anything very special about pizzeria prego even though i will probably never go back i suggest you try it if you are into the whole organic thing", "prego means to love and the love of pizza is nowhere more evident than at pizzeria prego this little shop is the only place in edmonton where you can get gluten free pizza and its fantastic according to the canadian celiac assocation in canadians is unable to absorb key nutrients due to damage caused to intestinal walls by gluten increasingly there are gluten free options so that celiacs can enjoy a diverse diet like people without dietary restrictions the trends toward organic and whole foods without preservatives have given gluten free products some buzz as a means to cleanse the body and drop excess weight so a pizzeria with gluten free dough and toppings is a welcome fixture in our eclectic community plus its awesome you can also get dough that is made of whole wheat sesame flax sunflower and pumkin seed there are two ovens one for gluten free and the other for regular ingredients so there is reduced risk of cross contamination however the restaurant does print a disclaimer on the menu that gluten free products may still come in contact with gluten products you feel less bloated after eating a gluten free pizza than regular kinds this does not mean you can pig out more but it means you can get a za fix without compromising your good eating habits", "i have no idea what all the complaints were about this place the pizza is outstanding i would go as far as to say it is some of the best pizza i have had in edmonton great customer service i had the spolumbo sausage which had italian sausage an insanely good meat sauce with obvious east indian influence peppers and tomatoes the heat factor in this little za was totally unexpected we also got the chicken alfredo which was even more delicious on a different level it had broccoli spinich chicken and alfredo sauce the chicken was cut up into huge chunks and the guy working the counter boasts that the cook makes whole chickens and then cuts them up himself its delicious but it is definitely a little more then your average pizza", "mmmmm pizzeria prego this place is great because its tiny and real sometimes i can not stand the big chain stores that just do not care these guys care about customers and about pizza the toppings on the pizzas here are fresh something that is hard to find these days and the pizza is not very greasy i really appreciated that about pizzeria prego because i love pizza but i do not eat it that often because of the grease that so often accompanies it the customer service here is great like i said they care its a unique little treasure on the south side", "is it possible to put no stars well we ordered a dollar pizza decided to get the last call and add some delicious vegetables the unfortunate part is being charge bucks per topping and then getting none of the extras you ordered id say we are very generous tippers we called the store to let them know what happened and the lady on the phone told us to call the manager on monday and hung up on us now one would think that sending the correct order would be the correct response to this situation however it appears that this establishment has little to no regard for continued commitment from their loyal patrons shameful really we emailed the manager at this location and the best they could offer was that we would get our toppings for free next time we order pizza needless to say we have no desire to order from these foolish people again", "i have always liked funky pickle pizza the pizza i got from this location was no exception funky pickle pizza is not greasy like the majority of pizzas in the city do not get me wrong i love greasy pizza on occasion but sometimes i just want good food funky pickle has good food funky pickle is still the only place where i have been able to get artichoke hearts on my pizza i know that it sounds a little disgusting i thought it would be too but it is so tasty do not judge it til you have tried it i do not think i have ever been disappointed with the pizza here its fresh and its delicious i always add chili flakes and parm cheese on top of my pizza to make it even better too its yummy in my tummy that is for sure funky pickle rocks how can you not with a name like that", "this does not even deserve the one star rating called later in the night on a saturday to order a pizza and cheese stix for delivery our order was put thru fine though the girl on the phone was not very friendly waited from about pm until past am still no pizza my boyfriend and i fell asleep waiting we called the next day to ask what had happened and if there is anything that could be donethe guy who answered told my boyfriend to call back monday morning and that is all he could do so then i called back to ask to speak to a manager or someone in chargethe same guy told me call back monday morning and there is no manager so i asked him where this location is and he told me his phone was ringing i heard no phone ringing and i asked again about the location of the store and he hung up on me worst customer service i have ever had rude rude rude", "if i could give i would i called and ordered a pizza and cheese sticks went through the order process answered a huge amount of questions more than once and had to spell it everything so the person on the other line could understand as if that was not bad enough the food tookwell id say a long time but we never got it waited an hour figured it was just busy waited a little longstill nothing looked at the clock after forgetting about it hours had gone by and it was past their closing time no pizza called back the next day was told they did not know anything so id have to call back later called back later asked for a manager or supervisor was told none work the weekend call monday i asked about the fact that no managers work weekends got back my phones are ringing sorry i asked again for a manager or how i could get a hold of one and got hung up on all of this while speaking to different individuals on different days that spoke very broken english", "funky pickle is probably some of the best pizza i have had its not the best but its in that range they do not skimp out on toppings or cheese and the pizza itself is not too thin or too thick the best part about it is that its not greasy so many pizza places serve pizzas that are just dripping with grease and sometimes it is just sickening a little grease is not bad its so good that it is almost hard to stop eating", "here is the thing i do not just like any pizza i like good pizza really good pizza i can not stand grease bland sauce or toppings that taste a week old this is where funky pickle comes in their pizza completely satisfies my pizza demands last time i went here i ate an entire inch pizza okay i did not but i shared it with only one other person we could not help but gorge it tastes so good that when you get to that point where you stomach hurts and you feel sick you go back for another piece anyways sometimes suffering is a good thing pretty much all the pizza varieties are good i especially like the wedgetarian lonely hearts has artichokes and last call special you can not really go wrong i do not think i have ever tasted a variety i did not like you can just buy one slice or order a whole pizza i particularly like this th street location they have cool art painted all over the walls and there is a big screen tv you can watch from the small seating area yes this pizza is a bit expensive but its well worth it they do have deals during the week though and if you visit their website you can print out a discount coupon", "placed an order waited an hour then called ohhh we did not see your order technical difficulties but reads me my order without me telling him what it was he tells me its going to be minutes longer i ask to just cancel the order as its now after midnight he calls his supervisor and says no we can not refund your order i paid online for contactless delivery so we will bring you cash they never sent the driver with the cash now i am out the money for the overpriced pizza and no pizza do not get scammed like i did", "first time trying to order placed o line after an hour and minutes with nothing delivered had to phone to find out where my order was told to call back in minutes if not there had a call minutes after talking to store from a delivery driver whom i could not understand whatsoever called store back again they said we will call you back after figuring out what is going on was told they would remake order as it wa extremely late so from original time of order to time i may have recieved a new order would have been hours from a place that is less than minutes from my home worst experience i have ever had and will definitely never try and order from this business again poor customer service red swan pizza waste of time", "so once a month i try to do a girls night in where we grab some take out and a couple of bottles of wine and our lounging clothes we were in the mood for pizza and my friend recommended red swan pizza which is a relatively a new chain that is popping up in edmonton one is conveniently located close to my house so i offered to grab the pizza for the evening browsing the online menu i was really impressed with the amount of different varieties of pizza they have i was intrigued with the amount of east indian fusion pizzas think spicy paneer butter chicken spicy ginger coriander however my friends are not into such exotic ones these i will have to try on a later date we decided on an extra large perogy pizza sour cream base potatoes italian sausage cheddar cheese mozzarella cheese we also chose the exotic lovers hot spicy with chorizo sausage hot capicollo mushrooms hot banana peppers green peppers pizza sauce mozzarella cheese when i went to pick up the staff there were quick and friendly both pizzas were delicious and i absolutely adored the crust the only downfall was that these pizzas are a little pricey for an extra large there are some mid week specials so i think the next time i will order i will try them it is a little more affordable however i think this is my new favourite pizza place for the at home date night", "really good specials for pick ups good selection of toppings no issues having them following special instructions would recommend everything but the wings not a fan", "i ordered the basic cheese pizza last week for delivery and it was great i always believed if they can get the basics right they can get anything right the cheese was very melty and i can taste they use several types of cheese on a basic cheese pizza the sesames on the side of the crust is a very nice touch", "awful they took the order and then just lost the order hr later i have no pizza i am now starving last bit of energy writing this yelp review dying no pizza sooooo hungry must call papa johns", "i ordered a stuffed crust bbq chicken pizza with extra cheese and steak from the saddleback road location in edmonton ab the pizza was not fully cooked the dough was raw underneath and we could not eat the pizza we tried contacting the location but was unable to reach the manager the pizza when delivered was smooshed and all on one side and mangled the toppings were not all on the pizza and it looked absolutely horrid we paid for the order by cash and the driver short changed me change with my payment the driver also gave an unprofessional attitude to us when he dropped the pizza off the steak on the pizza tasted rancid and dry as heck this has been the most disgusting pizza we have ordered this was my first time ordering from pizza hut and i will never order again i will be taking my business to another competitor who will have my business instead absolutely deplorable service and quality of product i rate this location a i highly recommend not ordering from this location", "as far as pizza huts go they are good do not expect much more than a greasy pan pizza but this is the only hut that will listen when i ask for well done pies they are quick and have friendly staff however sometimes the prices have been rung up incorrectly i explain the issue and its fixed but would like to avoid the awkwardness of that", "ordered pizza and fries to our hotel room it was a half hour late the driver was indifferent got up to the room and the pizza was cold and so were the fries but also soggy because they were packed in a plastic container they did not bring any plates napkins cutlery ketchup or salt no way to heat anything up and we could not complain or get a replacement because the pizza took so long that the store was closed by the time we received it i am sitting in my hotel room at pm eating cold soggy fries while my husband is out picking us up a pizza from pizza and its a sunday you guys how busy can they be at just reallydont bother with this place", "pizza is good as long as they get your order correct was in here a few days ago ordered a large hawaiian stuffed crust and a medium meat lovers after i paid my wife noticed there is a dollars deal for the nd rd th so i asked if i can order more he said sure but i had to pay regular price i asked why he said you already paid i was you did not even start making the pizzas the guy at the front desk did not speak good english and at times spoke in his language to me after min i got the pizzas when home opened them up and there was the hawaiian i ordered and a cheese pizza i will be looking else where then this location terrible service", "ordered pizzas for my family from the saddleback location i pre paid on their website including the tip i know i know big mistake which i really regret and will not do again in the future but i wanted to save the hassle at the door driver showed up minutes late even though the restaurant is minutes away when i asked why he was so late he just smiled and stated he did not realize he was actually late but that they had been very busy so it was possible he then politely told me better luck next time fair enough ill give him points for the positive attitude when we opened the boxes three of the five pizzas were inedible due to being burnt and the fact that the toppings were no longer on the pies but rather stuck to the box apparently my friendly driver must have gone off roading with our delivery and used our pizzas under his tires for better traction which explains his tardiness and the condition of our pies with all of the pizza restaurant options out there i would highly recommend trying any of those before considering ordering from the saddleback location", "great price not so great pizza few toppings and little to no sauce i am okay with the grease but my pizza tasted a little flat", "visited this location for a donation request on behalf of the southwest edmonton soccer association i was speaking with the employee at the counter who then passed the letter to a man in an office who was not visible they spoke for a brief moment then was passed back the letter and was told that corporate does all donation requests directly from the pizza hut website how can i request a donationsponsorship from pizza hut as we are a franchise business all donations and sponsorships are handled directly through our local restaurants we encourage you to prepare your request in writing and take it with you to your nearest restaurant by visiting during a non peak service time you will increase the opportunity that a manager will be able to personally meet with you to discuss your interests they will then gladly share your request with the franchise owner who will contact you if they are able to assist you with your request i will not be supporting a local businessfranchises who a lack business ethics b has their employees lie rather than having the balls to come out and speak directly to customers and c does not support local childrens sports", "steel wheels lyfe its just good drunken pizza just accept that its a delicious dive", "the girl behind the counter was very friendly and helpful based on service i would give stars the pizza needs alot more sauce on it the crust cheese and toppings were good but very dry due to almost no sauce please add more sauce guys i live nearby and would love to be a regular so help me help you", "great pizza but pretty prejudice demographic of customers if your not asian do not go at night their also too cheap to use debit its there is no reason to not have one unless your cheap", "terrible pizza of course and the beer selection was abysmal they also offer korean dishes which we noticed were being ordered more frequently than the pizza but only after wed gotten several slices for ourselves but the ambience kind of made up for it if we had not been the oldest people there and maybe if the pizza were less like pillsbury crescent roll dough with some sauce and cheese on top id come here more often the music was not obtrusive and we were able to have a conversation without screaming at the tops of our lungs which i have never encountered in this city in any bar like establishment after pm the younger folk were well behaved and not acting like drunken buffoons either a definite plus i do like the graffiti all over the place though i realize its probably not everyone is favourite d\u00e9cor scheme if i find myself nearby steel wheels again ill give their korean menu a go it has all the other elements in place to be a great spot", "pros the guys who run it are the amazing i miss the old guy but the new uncle is always nice to us good kimchi jigae they changed the pizza and it honestly tastes better now with a thinner crust also opens super late and cheap booze cons weirdass crowd on weekend nights", "there are defintely some ups and downs to this place let us start with the ups this place is great for if you are broke definitely the cheapest place on whyte to get a beer and a pizza only each creativity you can just come on in with markers and start drawing on the walls no one will draw on top of your art if it really is a masterpiece you have drawn but if its just your name someone will the owners do not mind it adds charm to the place and makes it more your own too to have added to it it can create a nice ambiance to the place friendly service even though i do not personally know the people running this place it was great and quick service from the start open late food this is great for getting food for after going to the bar and finding other options to eat rather than the traditional donair at a cheap price now to do the things i did not like food i wish i had read the reviews before i came in to find that they can do more than pizza and that they have free sauces to put on stuff there was not really a menu i could find except the one that said what type of pizza they sold and honestly for the price being sold the pizza is not so bad but it really is not that great if you want good pizza head elsewhere this is just a cheap alternative location ambiance and cleanliness this place is located off of whyte ave and its kind of sketchy makes you feel like you have to watch your back when you are coming here even more so when you are inside its all covered in grafiti but then you realize that all the clientele are just made out of a bunch of teens with their friends there is no real danger it just makes you feel that way its very uncomfortable its also very unclean when my group grabbed a table other than the fact that everything was covered in grafiti including the chairs and table the table had not been cleaned up so there was food and drink spills on it and from what i saw others tables do you had to clean it up yourself overall this place is a great find if you are broke and need to save every penny or you are drunk and want cheap food that late at night unfortunately for me i was not drunk nor am i broke so i did not have as much of an enjoyable experience next time ill be going somewhere i feel more comfortable safe and clean to eat", "hands down the best late nighthangover food in yeg the family that owns the restaurant is super nice their staple food would probably be the kimchi bulgogi pizza even though you have to order the whole pizza not just a slice worth though the place gives off a very chill vibe you can honestly just sit and talk while eating your food and feel no pressure to go or hurry up given there is no lineup bonus points for being open till am everyday can not go wrong with this place", "i am sorry but this place serves up terrible pizza at least the gentleman who helped me was both welcoming and nice id look elsewhere if i were you", "i go here on the regular love the atmosphere food and the people running it always greeted with a smile", "oh steel wheels you are by far one of the best dive bars on the ave you are the best to visit late at night when i am craving a green onion cake and beer with no frills attached this dive bar comes with a korean twist you can expect cheap beer pizza green onion cakes yes and some korean dishes i usually lean towards the green onion cakes or cheese pizza but the bulgogi pizza is a fav by others it opens later in the evening after pm till the wee hours of the morning this is not a dinner stop but rather a quick drink and snack break the place itself is covered in graffiti and paper plates adorned with individual creativity that might be the best way to put it super simple wooden booths no cushions here but you got to love the simplicity and trashiness at the same time the staff are always lovely though and the food comes out quick also lots of sauces to choose from for your cheap eats", "steel wheels has a lone redeeming quailty they serve green onion cakes late into the night a time when whyte avenue area dining options have been reduced to pizza donairs and microwave burritos but to get your hands on one of these little jewels you have to push your way through a sea of jocks and barbie dolls who are completely out of their minds after a night of pounding j\u00e4gerbombs at wooly bullys or one of the other area clubs after triumphing in my own battle to get through the door i found myself in front of an order window in a large dingy clapboard room it was decision time and i unfortunately opted to try the veggie pizza about halfway through the small doughy slice i cut my losses and threw it out i am not sure if it was the plasticky cheese the slightly spiced dough or the weird brown sauce that made a surprise appearance mid slice but it was the single worst slice of pizza i have experienced in living memory yet hordes of people surrounded me virtually inhaling it a testament to the level of drunkenness in the room food aside there is just a really negative atmosphere at steel wheels was it the schizophrenic wasteoid who was screaming obscenities and threats at us for trying to steal his jacket or perhaps the gang bottling that we apparently missed by moments but heard all about on the way out this is a pizza place for blackout nights and not for the faint of heart yummy quality slices can be obtained nearby at funky pickle or checkers with considerably less trauma involved", "i think my mistake was going in this place sober i was likely the only one the pizza was brutal i suppose if you are drunk and hungry at am it would be good but i was the dd and my tastebuds were sober enough to tell me the pizza was garbage", "i came here at am on a thursday night with friends and knocked on the closed door after seconds phil turned the lights on unlocked the door and fired up the ovens he always has a smile on his face and is just a great guy this place gets its business from the very drunk after bar crowd i have tasted the food there often on my breath the morning after and i have to admit its not good but you will not find a better place to sit and chow down after a heavy night", "ever wonder what the world would look like if graffiti was not only tolerated but encouraged come here its not that i have anything against graffiti its just that the vast majority of it here is awful its like they let loose a bunch of elementary kids to draw on the walls if your going to do graffiti make it beautiful if you are going to suck do everyone a favour and put the marker down before you hurt someone i have had the food here both sober and drunk i like it its simple and reasonably priced had bulgogi on rice for nice size good meat spicy broccoli and mushrooms so i do not feel guilty open until am on the nights its supposed to so its a good after bar option as well all in all this place is a pretty neat the owners are very nice folk", "been here a few times and thought i should write a review i like several things about steel wheels for starters when you enter this place you think you are in a shack like restaurant in an asian country weird random graffiti really bad quality of seating lighting and all complete lack of an ambience well that is not a great thing about this place but then again given that its open every nigth from pm to am i think its totally awesome also given that its right behind my apartment building and is a perfect place for me to get a cheap beer and spicy chicken with rice on a restless weeknight i like it well yes they have cheap and predictable beer i like the spring rolls and their spicy chicken teriyaki is pretty decent with rice have not tried their pizzas yet and do not know if i have the stomach for it i am not going to say that ill miss this place if i moved out of my neighborhood but i certainly like the option of getting a quick bite if i am too bored to cook some nights", "i have not been here since summer of it has not changed at all the bulgogi pizza is still the best of all the pizzas they have the crust from the pizza is just right and for pizza that is hard to do it was not greasy and the amount of cheese was just enough the graffiti decor is still around and the ceiling now have plates of art or sayings from random customers also had soju ice cold and for a decent price nothing to complain about here if you are adventurous and want to try something a bit different come here", "got dragged here by a local who said it was his favourite place ever and he could not live without it hmm maybe my expectations were set too high by this but it seemed only average to me it does have interesting decor patrons are encouraged to bring markers and write on absolutely everything and its cheap so i can see college students must love it however the pizza was only okay not amazing i had the bulgogi beef pizza at the recommendation of my companion who said it was the best they have but meh average ill leave this to the college students", "a friend brought me here if i were not already drunk when i walked into the place i probably would have turned around and left right away but i am glad i was maybe its just the soju talking but that kimchi pizza was like the best thing i have ever had i do not know how much it cost but i will have to go back just so i can get another one", "after reading about the bulgogi pizza i had to try it while the scant amounts of bulgogi i had on the pizza were tasty the pizza itself tasted stale steel wheels is completely shabby but the room has loads of charm especially if its am and you are drunk next time i think ill try something other than the pizza", "phil phil phil need i say more the best parts of edmonton are the ones you have to look for and steel wheels is one of its own hungry after a night on whyte ave and feeling the need to write your name on a piece of furniture legally then this delicious quick and sociable pizza place is for you the owner phil is known too by everyone on whyte ave hungry at am you walk in and yell his name and he gives you the biggest smile and hello you have ever seen the place is littered with drawings to phil from adults saying things such as you are pizza is awesome we love you philah yes we do all love phil pizza to for two slices spring rolls for for unless prices have changed recently and do not get surprised folks it is the best pizza i have ever had any kind of pizza you wish bulgogi hawaiian pepperoni and other classics i personally recommend the bulgogi with ranch and hot sauce on top do not knock it until you try it next time you are about to hail a cab after a night on whyte and you feel the urge for a near by mcdonalds or funky pickle just think of steel wheels and experience your first phil ism two thumbs an index finger up", "one of the best late night eats in edmonton known as a pizza place but their korea fare is actually pretty awesome do not be scared by the graffititagged wooden benches this place is fantastic i go for the kimchi jjigae will definitely need people and bulgogi on rice always with extra sauce crazy late night hours with friendly family service", "amazing food for an amazingly low price slices of pizza for the bulgogi pizza is a must also the owner phil is really friendly and enthusiastic love supporting local business", "another hidden gem an edmonton friend of mine introduced me to this place one drunken night out it is open late and that is probably the best time to go we ordered the bulgogi pizza and holy fuck was it was delicious the price was right and the mood was good honestly one of the better midnight pizzas i have had the staff was friendly and the place looks cool definitely something worth checking out", "ahahaha this place just cracks me up there is graffiti everywhere in this place which gives the impression that some motorcycle gang or scenester anarchist fucks run the place but no its some middle aged corean couple who are just fn hilarious and efficient it is hard to get both at the same time these days they do not look rock and roll but are they ever example one night at a different venue some edmontonians and i were discussing the flaws of our central banking system it escalated to a full on bar room brawl i had a huge gash with blood flowing down my face all that loss of blood made me hungry and my drunk ass cousin promised my drunk ass that everything was going to be all right alicia keys style if i followed him he lead me here i was worried who would take me in with blood flowing down my face he told me not to worry i go in worried that they would yell ohhhhnonononononono but they did not they got me a beer for and a slice of their bulgogi pizza for another incredible i wish calgary had some place like this", "a gem just off white ave cheap beer dollar bottles i believe its a korean bar but they have pizza you can write on the walls they are filled with graffiti great service and always great times", "get drunk stumble off whyte order the bulgogi pizza or a bulgogi meal slather it in all the free sauces and hassellhoff it down get a paint pen and sign in on the walls the owner phil is a delight and greets everyone with jubilant enthusiasm", "food is excellent for two slices of delicious korean pizza yes please the only thing i do not like about the place is it is always dirty and quite sticky so i had to take a star off for that i know the place is supposed to be grungy looking but at least clean the tables and mop the floor i wish they would have functioning locks on the bathroom doors i have walked in on people before and i have had people walk in on me kind of sucks when that happens they should really fix that", "one of the best late night food place in edmonton it is a cash only place but they have a really good and cheap food the bulgogi meal is really good and one of the reason why would i drive all the way from north to south just to get it they have their bulgogi pizza too which one of the crowds favourite just do not go late at night especially around the weekends because the line up gets really long", "everyone loves phil there is no denying it how could you not friendliest asian guy and tolerant to a lot of racket steel wheels has become a staple to whyte aves what happened last night scene the walls are covered in random hilarious graffiti and is probably the only place you can get away with writing profanity in huge block writing the only thing i do not do here is go to the bathroom seriously the bathroom at steel wheels is straight out of a saw movie no thanks this place gets packed after hours but luckily i decided to go during the early part of the night to get some personal attention from phil and not have a drink spilled on me after my first korean experience i decided to get a bulgogi slice i have been here before so i know the general wait time but since we were not here during rush hours our za took a little more love and time finally our steaming cheesy pizza came out unfortunately we took it to go so i did not get to eat it fresh and use the sauce here but after some toaster ovening at home and mixing hot sauce and ranch my pizza was ready to deliver once again i am not sure what he does to the crust but it looks like its sneaky healthy its kind of brown and definitely has spices packed in the bits of beef were packed with tons of flavor they were a little dry could be from me reheating but it was still delicious and so much cheese holy a cheese atarians fantasy was on my slice ill have to come back and have one of these babies fresh did i mention that its only for two slices", "the ultimate dive bar but in a way that warms my jaded millenial heart the ultimate cheap eats for a night on whyte ave with pizza beer green onion cakes and booths and tables decorated with graffiti this place is not for the easily squeamish and may not be a germophobes dream but what it lacks in polished charm it makes up in thrifty charm a comfortable spot to catch a drink and share a pizza or grab some kimchi when you are out late plus did i mention it is incredibly friendly on the wallet because it is", "got the bulgoki pizza which everyone recommended the price is cheap indeed and the pizzas crust is definitely one of a kind however i do not really like it for it has too much cheese and so little meat oh well you got what you paid for would not come back to this place any more", "the place is cool and onwer is also cool when he is talking nice night snacks place", "everyone knows about steel wheels pizzeria its a staple when you are out late on whyte ave and want something greasy to soak up all of the alcohol that you have consumed during the night i have been here a couple times now never by choice haha and its simply what you would call a grungy hole in the wall hangout the booths and walls are lined with graffiti and doodles it definitely has character ill give them that this is the spot if you want to pre or post drink and get late night eats open pm to am err day each time that i have visited there is always a lineup but it usually moves at a reasonable pace the menu is split into pizza two for and korean foodsnacks fyi the pizza is nasty i do not know how people gulf that stuff down but i shudder just reminiscing about it the crowd that comes here is always interesting with a mixture of students and young professionals spicy squid on our most recent visit i introduced m to the wonders of steel wheels she is never been but that is because she is not a local we decided to try their spicy squid which by the way does not come with any rice in case you were expecting that the squid was nice and tender with a good level of heat to it we were both pleasantly surprised a bunch of vegetables rounded out the rest of the dish onion green peppers and broccoli dumplings you get pieces of dumplings when we had them they came out piping hot and to my surprise they were actually pretty good juicy and fresh green onion cake the green onion cake also came out hot and fluffy good enough to make everyone happy bulgogi on rice beef broccoli mushroom green pepper bulgogi and rice my friend could not stop gushing about the ranch sauce so she doused that on both of our meals i do not know what the big deal was it was just ranch sauce pretty sure you need to be drunk to appreciate that combo chicken on rice same as the bulgogi on rice but with chicken instead i have to say this was a first seeing broccoli in a korean dish for me it reminded me of my lunch at chicken for lunch the sad thing with this one was that i asked for really spicy the lady told me it would be but upon taking my first bites nada hardly any spice for that matter i have had the tofu soup a long time ago which i remember being pretty good food wise the best advice i can give is stick with the korean dishes avoid the whiteified rice meals and you will be okay come here with a bunch of buddies and you will have a good time soju anyone", "steel wheels is my favorite place and i have loved it ever since day one atmosphere food price and service are all amazing phil is a super charismatic dude and his wife and kids that work the front end are incredibly nice as well i really recommend it especially if you are rounding off a night on whyte much much better than a donair or whatever other fastfood place is still open at am", "its not the best pizza i have had but it is an awesome unique place to go the bulgogi pizza is really yummy especially with ranch and teriyaki sauce drizzled liberally on top although i have heard that it gets really busy i go earlier in the evening and its nice and peaceful my boyfriend and i split a pizza and it was only about", "oh steel wheels i have many memories of this quirkly little pizza joint well not so much memories as hazy recollections of shenanigans here is what you will get when you walk stumble into steel wheels confusion about where you are were not on whyte ave anymore toto a sudden and strange urge for a black sharpie to match the drunken graffiti on every booth and all over the bathrooms and of course a craving for greasy greasy pizza not the best pizza i have ever put in my mouth but i do not crave high end eats at that point in the game anyway order by the slice its cheap and say hello to phil for the second weekend in a row", "i read the review saying do not let the decor deter you so decided to try their pizza we liked the vibe liked the staff hated the pizza bought a full veggie pizza little on it way too much crust very disappointing wanted to love it ended up tossing it totally skimped on the ingredients did not even get all the ones that were listed the crust should not be the major defining point of the pizza maybe the people who rate it so highly never order a veggie pizza but even if that is so there is no excuse for the lack of ingredients basically a pizza round with some white cheese on top and a couple of ingredients", "love this little hidden gem family run family loved i could not believe i had lived in the city off and on for years and i had never heard of this place then one night after an event a killer local dj brought us here after a show your first time is always the best but every time after you adore it just as much perfect pizza that is just plain different and ultimately simple amazing service from the sweetest folk and the coolest vibe and street decor", "this is probably the best cheap late night food on whyte ever they serve korean flavoured pizza and some other stuff like rice and i believe noodles as well the price is super reasonable and the food was pretty good as well they are only open from i think pm am so its perfect for a night owl like me i love how they have their own private parking area which is great for an area like whyte ave esp during their opening hours on a weekend the decor is pretty much graffiti on the furniture and the walls are decorated with plates designed by customers its a super cool concept will definitely come back with friends for late night food", "came here late one night with the family only three tables taken at pm this restaurant closes at am located close to whyte ave there is a parking lot west of the building and three spots in front the decor is very unique graffiti everywhere except the floor the walls picnic tables and booths are covered with fun and colourful writing and drawings even stuff on styrofoam plates attached to the walls and ceiling we ordered bulgogi meal kimchi backbone soup and budae soup very good prices bulgogi for and soups and i would not order the bulgogi meal again as it looked and tasted very fast food ish a bit disappointed with this choice the soups were very tasty and more authentic budae soup had pork tofu ramen bean and cheese and came with a bowl of rice this dish is also known as army stew the backbone soup also came with a bowl of rice i would eat here again if looking for a place that closes late and would definitely try a few other items on the menu", "this spot has so many memories for me so when we decided to go back for a visit i was a little sad to see that it has changed hands and phil is no longer the owner the food is still basically the same cheap pizza that hits the spot after a night of drinking some spicy korean dishes that are always good too we usually opt for the bulgogi beef pizza or the bulgogi meal medium spicy they also sell drinks too the graffiti decor is still there but they have covered the tables in a type of acrylic so that its much easier for them to clean and also people can no longer write on the tables overall its a fun experience kind of place food is cheap and fills you up service is very friendly and patient check it out", "interesting menu very enjoyable wish i could get down there more great atmosphere kind of like an art project decor", "this place is a whyte ave staple it is the furthest thing from fine diningand that is fine its been many years since my drunken days on whyte closer to than id care to admit but as i drove up a hazy memory of stumbling in here came to mind steel wheels has been here for quite some time and what a unique little anomaly it is the fact that they are still going is testament to the sheer volume of buisness they must get on any given night i can imagine a long line of revelers looking for a late night snack as i stopped in at on a week night there was no one else in the place this was great as it gave me ample opportunity to appreciate their one of a kind decor graffitieverywhere it is litterally the patrons who have scrawled their presence onto every surface they can reach i have heard a rumor that every few years they paint over everything and start freshbut i can not confirm this as for complaints i read about the cleanlineswellit is painted with permanent markerso what does anyone expect at for two slices which many a light eater would suffice the value is second to none i myself indulged in slices two of their famous bulgoki and two pepperoni topped off with a bottle of water which at is almost unheard of total was a mere fantastic value pizza is as simple as it can be the crust is a unique bread which was quite good but not crusty at all sauceminimal a few pieces of meat respectivelyand a mess of cheese that is it to sum it all up this is the perfect place to come if you are one who finds themselves hungry on whyte afteror during an eveningor even morningof good times if only these walls could speak", "one thing i am missing during the pandemic is getting drunk and coming to steel wheels at midnight to get a pizza and maybe swig a milkis over some korean food while laughing obnoxiously with my friends the staff here is extremely patient and kind if you are unfamiliar with korean food they will take their time to describe a dish to you the pizza here is definitely a drunk food favourite with my preference being the beef bulgogi pizza while its not your classic neapolitan delight its inexpensive and honestly pizza is pizza it gets the job done the crust is pretty thick and is comparable to pizza hut but the real star of this is the bulgogi sauce it comes with it makes everything taste x better if you are the type of person to leave the crusts on pizza this sauce is going to change your opinion", "have been there saturday last week for dinner whow never been this disappointed like there first of all its like a barn with graffiti all over the place its their theme so far ok prices like in a restaurant and just bran tables and benches nothing else blank tables and benches out of wood full graffiti service none order at a desk pay and they call you to pick up your food no waiter nothing but expectations for tips for what for nothing ridiculous you have to get your food at the counter its served on styrofoam plates and plastic fork and knifes when you are done you have to clean your own table and bring everything in a garbage bin we out the empty bottles on the counter was not right had to put them on the floor in a box as i said they want to be a restaurant and its not more than a food truck business with overpriced food we paid so much for the main dish and it was just an appetizer shame on this business ever again one star is already overrated for this place", "wow quite the experience the graffiti is unlike anything i have ever seen in a restaurant and some of the illustrations are unlike anything i have ever seen period the food is a mixed bag i could see returning to try the various stir fries again the spice and flavour were good and i was pleased with amount of veggies included however i would avoid the pizza some reviews rave about it but if you notice almost all of those mention the inclusion of booze andor other substances perhaps their judgment was a bit impaired the weakest part of the pizza to me was the crust it was heavy and dry yet oily my wife commented that the yellow colour and flavour of the pizza crust matches pillsbury pizza dough could it be that they use pillsbury crust would that explain why you are always told it will be ready in minutes for every order if you have never been to steel wheels try it if you have i am guessing you either loved it or hated it you can decide which side i am on", "meh deep dish pizza close to the starlite room light on sauce light on quality employees heavy on the bread and mozzarella if your intoxicated and fresh out of a show anything tastes good i would not go out of my way to pay dollars for this mediocre pizza they are have been in edmonton since but clearly years of experience have not served them well employees were mediocre pizza was mediocre place was not so great no seating carryout or delivery only move on yelpers", "food poising alert think twice before eating here they have no problem selling rotten pizza by the slice and the customer service is abhorrent you are better off hitting papa johns on jasper ave on th", "great customer service from the minute i called to the minute it was delivered had trouble with the debit machinedriver stated it was old and that he was going to request a new model but i had cash in the house no biggy great pizza first time ordering from here lots of toppings loads of cheese excellent food overall definitely recommend and definitely will re order in the future", "pizza was oookkkkaaayyyynothing special but whatever you dodo not order the greek salad lol", "tried this for the first time tonight pizza toppings and crust tasted like fresh and homemade pizza delicious huge portions a large could easily feed to people it was great i will definitely order again when i crave deep dish", "twice in a row my order was messed up first time we got someone elses pizza tonight after it took an hour to get here we found out they missed a pizza its unfortunate they used to be better than this now my wife has to go out and get something else because she can not wait another hour incredibly unhappy with the service and will not be ordering from chicago deep dish again", "horrible horrible food id stay away if i were you you have been warned", "decided to try this for the first time as my friend said its very filling because they stack toppings hence the name deep dish turns out the crust and pizza bread is just reaally thick and toppings are the same as anywhere else i am not sure if its just this location specifically but ill likely never order from this chain again due to this lol pay a lot more for more carbs i guess", "i see why this location only had stars i have been to a lot of boston pizza locations in edmonton and this one is by far the worst we came in with only other tables being used and it took over hours to get our food when it came out order was wrong and my mother got plum sauce for her salad dressing instead of italian dressing with the meal they got wrong it came back worse than when it was originally brought out they are lucky the bathrooms were nice or this would have been a star review", "i come here frequently as its close to home the service and pizza are always great but for a change i decided to order the spaghetti and meatballs today big mistake the meatballs were brown and bland as was the bolognese sauce no flavor or seasonings whatsoever in both their sauce and meatballs and there was not enough tomato sauce overall in this dish this was the worst spaghetti dinner i have had in years i think ill just stick to what boston is good at and famous for from now on their amazingly delicious pizzas", "this review is only for the service as we did not stay to eat was in the neighborhood today and saw the bp and decided to stop for dinner we got seated to a table right away after that never got to speak to the waitress again there was only other tables filled in the restaurant with waitresses after sitting waiting to give our order we had been there over minutes no drinks water or anything i flagged the waitress ask if we can put in our order she said she would be right with us we waited a few more minutes she never stopped by so we left never stop at that location again", "this was just another prime example of a firm belief i have that not all chain restaurants are created equal we came in an hour after opening and with only two other tables occupied somehow managed to get the kind of service that you would expect when the place is packed it took forever to get our first drink refill and after that no more were offered even when we asked for the dessert menu food was alrightthe bun that came with my buffalo chicken sandwich was very fresh and the chicken tasted perfect with just the right amount of hot sauce to be spicy but not totally overwhelming my salad tasted a little wilted and almost like it had come from a bagged salad kit the worst part of the whole meal was dessert my apple crisp came out burnt and it seemed like they tried to cover it up by adding a larger scoop of ice cream to mine then the scoop they put on my boyfriends brownie thankfully they did not charge us for it but i still was not impressed i am not a foodie nor am i skilled in the kitchen but even i could tell just from looking at it that it was not going to be edible so for a trained cook to send that out to a customer seems slightly insulting there are bps all over the city so i do not think you would be hard pressed to find another one close by and you will not be missing anything by not coming here", "went into this place this evening not sure what to expect but looking for a decent donair i walked in to a smiling face and two happy people husband and wife team looking to serve me the best donair i could have i ordered two jumbo loaded and they did not disappoint as they were packed full of veggies and delicious donair meat we had ours with tzatziki sauce that was very good but we could have also had garlic or sweet sauce we ordered the combos and the fries were hot and fresh and i believe fresh cut such a great experience well be back for pizza highly recommend it", "best donair in sherwood park the ingredients look fresh the sauce is on point and there is a crunch in the meat that edges it above the rest", "well i can say that if you need something food shaped at am they will deliver do not expect high quality here however the pizza had a flavour that was both bland and strange at the same time i would say it was the grease but it was more than just the lack of other flavours that made it really terrible the reason i give them stars is was also ordered potato skins and those were decent maybe stay away from the pizza here i am not rushing back to try the rest of the menu", "the pizza delivery was late the crust was thin but that is because it was soaked in grease", "absolutely delicious and a great neighbourhood joint friendly staff quick service hearty amounts of toppings and beautifully crispy crusts make for tasty eats definitely recommended if you are sick of the garbage that chain pizza joints dish out", "i live in the area and started to hear about this new pizza place so after a long day of work decided to give it a try i ordered a large garlic chicken pizza as that sees to be their most popular pizza not usually my type they said it would take minutes so headed next door to the coffee shop and had a hot chocolate this is not an eat in place minutes later headed backed and picked up the pizzathe staff was very friendly and seems to be all family it was a great pizza their pizzas are thin crust and my experience with thin crust pizzas is they are soggy this is not it had great texture and flavour i will definitely be giving them more business", "highly recommended not a big placeso do not expect a restaurant setting small tables and chairs great service and amazing pizza", "grade a some of the better pizza found in south edmonton my family has ordered from a variety of places eg royal pizza bp famoso panago pizza papas johns papa murphys etc and when we discovered stone and wheel we were pleasantly surprised as to the high quality and abundance of toppings also the pizza is not all breadcrust you actually taste the toppings and the amount of cheese is very generous i highly recommend you order and try out this pizzeria", "i feel like this pizza is the best pizza a lot better than the chain pizza places domphut etc only thing i do not like is that most times i call they do not have a delivery person so i have to walk to get my pizza however not the end of the world", "we stopped in to watch the hockey game we ordered a caesar salad to start two diet pepsi a burger and the garlic shrimp spaghetti sub bow tie pasta the place was totally slammed and our waitress did her best the salad was super good and so was the burger the pasta was over cooked bland and sitting in a pool of oil we asked for a side of alfredo sauce to try to salvage the meal howeverthe pasta was just so bad the only thing edible was the garlic toast when our waitress came at the end of the meal her second appearance since getting the food we advised how bad it had been the pasta and how we could not eat it she asked if we wanted something else and we declined when she returned with the bill she had pre entered the price into the machine and placed the bill upside down in the middle of the table she advised she had discounted the bill after she left the table we looked at the receipt and saw the pasta was on the bill for the original as well as a charge for the alfredo then at the bottom there was a discount for making the cost for a piece of garlic toast and of a bad meal over we were disappointed with the adjustment so we spoke to a manger he advised no credit could be done on a debit charge and that he would give us a in store credit this discount brought the piece of toast down to a total of i guess if that is how they choose to get return business that is fine but we were definitely left with a sour chain restaurant taste in our mouths", "in town for a wedding boston pizza was a good fit for our family burgers pizza and salads all pretty good", "unfortunately had to leave before ordering food due to a cold hostess and a unclean booth and menus the server was understanding and i hope to return to give this family restaurants another shot formy business", "we were here for my sons th birthday celebration with the family a table of the service was amazing billi t was our server and she was efficient very nice and cheerful the drinks were out right away and the kids food was out first as requested the rest of the food also came out in a timely fashion and everything was great the staff even brought out a free brownie and sang happy birthday to my son he was very happy dessert also came out quick and the separate bills came out quick even the payment process was fast this place is a great family restaurant with amazing and fun filled activity packs for the kids too", "it was just ok both my husband and i ordered pasta seafood fettuccine and jambalaya seafood was very bland jambalaya was fine got the mini burgers for our daughter she would not eat them and she is not fussy waitress was missing in action most of the time although they did seem quite busy food took a long time and then we stood round for minutes trying to get the bill would not return when there are so many other options in the vicinity", "erin was amazing in the lounge just went in for pizza and a beer and she was attentive friendly and efficient she was cleaning when we left because no one was in the restaurant the mark of a hard worker", "i have been here a few times and never reviewed it until today a friend of mine her husband and i came here for lunch and sat in the lounge it was really quiet for pm we were the only ones in the place boy this was deja vu our drinks were delivered promptly but we needed a few minutes to put in a food order we ordered two individual pizzas hawaiian and perogy and thai chicken bites while we waited i pointed out that pineapple does not belong on pizzas yes i am one of those pineapple does not belong on pizza its not even hawaiian a canadian named sam panopoulos a greek restaurant owner invented it so that is my point pineapple is a fruit and should not be in food pineapple chicken is another one yes it is delicious but come on you do not put strawberries on steak do you unless it is a dessert same goes for perogies it does not belong on pizza the italians should lose their minds over what we have done to pizza it did not take long for it to arrive and it looked great the pizzas were perfect and my thai chicken bites were delicious although i am a hockey fan my friends husband asked for the golf channel instead which was quickly changed i guess when you are the only ones in the lounge you can get away with it without an uproar our waitress ashley was great and had a good sense of humor she asked if we wanted anything else so i asked for thousand dollars she said to me if she ever gets a tip that big she would give it to me so i am hoping and i promised if she did that i would at least take her on a vacation overall it was a good place to go for a few drinks and watch a game food was great ashley was friendly and attentive which i appreciate just as much as the food overall i will be back for sure", "we visited this boston pizza on a cold blizzard evening the restaurant was nearly empty but the restaurant was fully staffed my husband ordered the hawaiian pizza and states that the cheese did not take like cheese but the pizza sauce was delicious i had the shrimp tacos and thought the ingredients were quite fresh and everything complemented each other with a squirt of lime dessert was the best part as we indulged in chocolate brownie and churro donut the brownie was warm and gooey but unfortunately the churro donut was missing the first ingredient listed the cinnamon sugar so it lacked a bit of flavour overall i would definitely return due to the attentive and friendly service but their food menu could use a set of attentive eyes", "i come here often and lately service has declined today had to wait minutes just for them to bring ketchup to my son there were other tables in the section she walked by twice before offering my son a refil while his cup was on the edge of the table the whole time not a single smile did not check up until i was almost done my food when it came time to pay the server sent someone else with a debit machine to collect payment i was not paying with debit i still had half a beer remaining and my sons desert was full when i said i was paying cash she tried to take the receipt from in front of me until i said ill pay when we are done she did apologize and say the server sent her with the machine so not sure why she would do that horrible service throughout good food i have worked in the service industry a very long time and its sad to see how low the standards have gotten last time i was there weeks ago service was equally horrible if not worse i am always friendly polite and smiling most likely will not be returning", "definitely order from here if you would like to starve to death because apparently the delivery driver is dead somewhere and i am about to join him because my stomach ate itself", "we have been to this bps a number of times now and every time we come here we are treated well and with excellent customer service and prompt drinks and food today we were here just to watch the football game and have a snack our server christina not only asked the manager to change one of the tvs to the game but after realising that we were the only patrons watching tv he changed all the tvs to the game not only do we feel extremely welcome and at home here it is a joy to be here and meet friends here as well we recommend this boston pizza to everyone in the area as an awesome place for food drinks hanging out and good fun", "i love this bps this is the new look for boston pizza and it looks amazing the lounge is beautiful and there is a giant screen for sports so cool the service is always good and the food well the great thing about bps is that i can always count on the menu to be similar in all locations usually i grab some wings or pasta today however i had a craving a craving that only boston pizza could fulfill and that for not only for bacon but double bacon i ordered the double bacon bbq burger a deliciously exquisite but zesty creation cooked with jack daniels bbq sauce and covered with strips of bacon yaaaayyyyyyy i was a happy camper almost to the verge of tears my wife had the oven roasted quesadilla and she did not have the same experience the flavour of the sun dried tomatoes which have recently been added did not sit well in her stomach i looked at hers and it definitely looked and smelled strange we would recommend going back to the previous recipe without the sun dried tomatoes that was much better looking forward to going back", "i was trying to order some delivery late at night and came across new york pizza through deliverytownca at first i was hesitated but i decided to give it a try i was very impress with the deliver time we got the pizzas within an hour and they were hot when they arrived to be frank the pizza is not superb but definitely not a bad option if you are hungry at in the morning on a friday night", "fucken worst pizza ever took for ever i received it cold i called and told them they basically did not say shit just to nook it worst pizza ever so fucken did appointed do not buy anything from these guys honestly i never return food or complain i just do not eat but this pizza is shit service shit timing shit the guy even hung up on me willl never eat from these guys ever again ever fuckkkkkkk", "the absolute worst service i have ever gotten in my life we ordered wings late last night and they told us half an hour so minutes rolls by and still no wings i called them to see what was going on first of all the guy put me on hold and did not even say hello or anything then i asked if my wings were still coming and he said we are busy they are coming and hung up on me when i was still talking i called back and asked why he had hung up and he said that i was drunk and harassing him because service took way longer than expected i requested a discount for the long wait and he basically laughed it was the must unprofessional and rude encounter i have ever come across i hope this shitty place goes out of business and this guy gets a seriously reality check", "i would not recommend this to anybody here is why the food took about minutes that was the only good part the wings looked like it was some other persons food microwaved too the baked spaghetti looked like it was the noodles slabbed with sauce and cooked the garlic bread was the worst thing i have ever tasted its a peace of bread lightly toasted and lightly buttered with small pinch of garlic if you are desperate this is the pace for you but i am telling you now i do not recommend this to any body at all the food was overall bland and tasteless if you do not believe me go try it out here is the address street avenue", "i was very hungry looking for a quick place to eat while i was waiting on laundry when i walked in i immediately felt like the place was a ghetto the place looked quite dirty tables with sauce still stuck on and the kitchen looked like it has not been cleaned in months despite this i wanted to at least try the food the man who took my order looked like he just got out of bed wearing a t shirt with holes and sweat pants that looked dirty when i saw him make my food i saw no signs of hand washing even after he scratched his behind handled my food with bare hands even when i decided to eat the food the bun was really soggy and the food tasted ok i looked up the restaurant and found it has had critical health safety violations against it food is overpriced i paid for a burger and fries needless to say i will never eat here again", "delivery requires a minimum order of plus an included tip that does not count towards the order minimum unless you are really drunk and its the middle of the night pick a different place", "got a flyer under our door at the hotel ordered a pizza chicken wings and a greek salad for our crew we were told it would be min an hour later we had to call to find out about the order when it finally arrived the delivery person tried to charge us for a order when we dug into the food the pizza was burned the greek salad had been tossed with oil but nothing else th chicken wings were only ok all around disappointing never again", "just ordered from here and since they were open late i figured what the heck i went to their website and apparently it has not been updated i ordered the variety pack with the medium pizza pasta with meat sauce a donair and an order of their crazy cheese bread and dip the website says it is but it is now actually it arrived and i dug in to the donair and the sauce is blah i have eaten donairs on the east coast ontario and here and i have not had a decent donair sauce in the city of edmonton the garlic crazy bread is kind of bland with delivery and tip i spent a total of for this and i will most likely never order from here again happy eating", "my favorite dish is the butter chicken pasta i have it with the corn pasta because i like the flavour better the butter chicken pizza is also great and as usual the service is quick enough to keep my toddler occupied with the colours and then the food", "i am going to put this in short i had ordered a pie from here came with sour cream buddy was at my door and he accidentally dropped it on the ground no biggy i said id use my own best part he said he would clean it i said cool tyvm closed the door he left did not clean it called the restaurant and the manager told me to f off because i wanted the driver to return to clean it real classy", "i placed an order online from this location it took over an hour for delivery which i can mostly understand since they are primarily a dine in restaurant and it was a friday but when it arrived they had sent us the wrong hamburger the fettucini alfredo was cold with barely any sauce and the sauce that was there did not look creamy but rather congealed from how cold it was and the side of chicken breast i ordered to go with the pasta was not actually a whole chicken breast but rather one lonely burnt slice of a chicken breast called the number listed on my order confirmation waited on hold for fifteen minutes with the call centre which has some terrible hold music by the way only to have a chipper guy named cole tell me they can not handle online order complaints and very politely give me the number for the location that processed my order which was this one called the location asked to speak directly with the manager and the experience gets a bit more pleasant from here he was quick to apologize and to offer to send us the correct hamburger order and to replace the side order of chicken breast for my meal at no extra charge i was tired and grumpy by that point and forgot to mention my fettucini alfredo was so icky so it is not his fault that it did not get replaced the delivery guy returned about minutes or so later with the corrections as promised unfortunately we were all a bit tired my alfredo did not heat well in the microwave and it was a bit of a meh dinner not quite what i would expect after paying as much as i did for what was supposed to be a delicious meal if i order boston pizza online again it will not be from this location i was pleased with how the manager handled the situation but i would have been happier had there not been a situation to begin with", "in terms of boston pizzas this is not the worst location but its not the best by a long shot either service is slow and wait staff often do not stop by your table to check on you after you have ordered every time i come here i feel like i have stepped into a deep freeze the place is cold bring a sweater or you will be shivering the entire time in terms of experience its a miss but the food is always good and arrives fairly quickly which is the most important part", "i have never eaten in at this location but i recently placed an online order and picked it up i had placed a large order as it was for four people and a number of things were incorrect i came home to find that our cans of pop were the wrong kind we were missing a side salad and one of the kids order of mini burgers came with mustard even though i had added a note asking for no condiments on the burgers it was frustrating but i decided not to go back and have everyone wait for dinner i may order again simply because the food was tasty and the location is convenient but i will check the order in the car next time", "i had lunch at this bp on a day that they offered personal size pizzas for that price i am willing to deal with the indigestion and acid reflux but if i had to pay full price i would not be happy its a weird location on the corner of a busy intersection facing north toward the the street ill probably never come here again but we may order for pick up since my lady loves the spicy pierogi pizza", "do not order from here unless you do not mind being dissatisfied i have attempted delivery with them times and had enough staff are poorly trained not very tentative no sense of urgency or caring i have had two deliveries from them and the third time they told me that i lived outside their boundaries even though they delivered before and its blocks away so i got take out the third time first time delivery was okay second time over minutes i called the hotline for follow up they told me to call the store so i did but only to get hung up every time she said hold please the third time the hotline told me to call the store to place an order because they could not find my address on their system the girls only answered and then said call the hotline for delivery then hung up all three times something was missed napkins for four meals no wet naps i have over packages of chilli flakes in my cupboard but rarely got parmesan for spaghetti as promised do not forget the garlic toast id say but it was always missed food is always not bad good thing their pizza is good lukewarm i did not complain i am a person who just will not go back i do not ever criticize a restaurant but this bps has only let me down over and over yes its the small details but they are in small detail business they will automatically take your change at the counter as a tip without asking at least he tried when i got take out the third time and change not much but when i get shit service i will not tip a dime id rather tip very well or none at all", "generally when one goes to a chain restaurant they expect a certain average of service unfortunately for other boston pizzas that bar was just raised food i had ordered the double bbq burger with a side of fries and gravy while the fries were not the greatest soggy not crispy possibly due to a heat lamp they were more than made up by the burger itself the meat was fresh and juicy nothing tasted really overcooked a bit to much and every bite was just as good as the last service i swear our server was a ninja or something while there were not many groups where we were eating our server was able to give everyone above average service literally every time i looked up he was helping a different customer and none looked to be really peeved from our non existant wait times i will most likely come back to this bps in the future", "excellent service staff especially in the loungeprices continue to rise though and they now stock a cheaper brand of wine have run out of certain liquor on some nights unforgivable for a boston pizza no real recognition by management for loyal customers", "the worst service i have ever experienced in edmonton lived here all my life asking for anything was like causing a massive in connivence wings order was wrong and all they did was send out the dipping sauce of the wings i was supposed to get", "this is my favourite bps location in the city the staff are great service is so fast my pick up orders are always correct hot and ready when i arrive there is lots of cheese and toppings on the pizza and i like their crust its thicker its a bit hard to get to but its right near my work very happy customer", "got a donair pizza from here the meat had a nice flavour and the sweet sauce was good as well i would imagine the donairs are good as well", "it smells delicious as soon as you come in to the nice bright restaurant and its always been delicious food pizzas burgers and donairs its all so good", "roma is another great pizza place we order from the sherwood park location which is not too far from us in se edmonton last time ordered greek salad margherita pizza canadian pizza and fries always fries for the munchkin crust is nice and thick sauce is yummy lots of cheese on their cheese pizzas we order from here every couple of months pretty delicious", "we order from here via skip the dishes quite often but i called directly to place an order for pickup the other day so now i feel like i can write a good review more often than not we get pizza they have a very tasty veggie pizza with onions olives mushrooms and tomatoes and the cheese pizza is delicious as well i have also had donairs here and they are massive like absolutely huge i am not ashamed to say that i have had to use a knife and fork on them in the past because it was just too big to hold the husband and wife team who run it are so friendly it makes me feel like they really enjoy being there the only thing we have not loved is the greek salad which was actually inedible and we threw it away the dressing on it seems to just be oil and oregano mixed together but it maintains a very gritty texture and all i could feel and taste was oregano ill skip that next time and probably stick to the onion rings when i need a side dish i suppose its my own fault for trying to order vegetables from a donair shop overall very pleased", "we love roma pizza family owned business we are so happy to have these guys in our neighbourhood they are super friendly and have awesome food their donair pizza is our family go to love supporting a local business and really appreciate the friendly service", "ordered from roma on saturday night using skip the dish roma has become my husbands favorite pizza if i was just reviewing the pizza it would be a five star review ordered a deluxe and margherita pizza and some chicken nuggets with onion rings asked for the deluxe without onions and it was made to order the sauce is a nice thick pizza sauce and its incredible lots of cheese on both and cooked perfectly the reason this review is only four stars is because the nuggets were not great i can not find a better word than cheap tasting did not even both with a picture next time we will try the chicken fingers instead the onion rings they came with were delicious though roma will be our go to pizza delivery place from now on", "roma used to be great and well ran seems like there is new owners now and it has gone down wait times are insane you order and pickup its never ready when it says its going to be food is still great but when each time its the same story we have now will stop going here", "tried the pizza there for the first time tonight fantastic thinner crust than what you would usually get from a typical pizza shop very fresh toppings owner was very friendly and personable i will be ordering from here again call them directly for pick up or delivery", "thought about putting some support behind this new establishment until i saw the owners wife take their child to put in the car after getting the child sorted she cleaned her garbage out and threw it on the ground literally right in front of their own business i called and although the guy answering admitted he was the owner and that was his family the most he did was look at the garbage out his window we were in the area for another hour and nobody picked up her trash i find this a disgusting display of ignorance", "the person you are dialing is not taking any calls at the moment that is what i get at in the morning from whenever we feel like it pizza", "as we stood there baked out our minds at am and needed food this random place appeared in the distance with its hour service we called ordered jumbo donairs and they were well let us just say if its am and you need food this place will do other than that nope", "horrible pizza and the service is worse i waited hrs then they called me saying it will be another mins", "i ordered from here for the first time thinking id be impressed and happy to eat my food nothing but disappointment called in my order then a hour later my food arrives to get my food all cold the drive was mins away from where i live and it took an hour for what exactly when i got my food my fries with all cold and solid hard dry like they were sitting there for awhile or they had freezer burn and still fried them disgusting my lasagna was all bland and soggy my garlic toast was just butter and toast no garlic or basil spices on it and when me and my boyfriend asked if they just let everything just sit there for an hour then to decide to deliver the food the mans response to my boyfriend was dude we just threw them in they should should be nice and warm not hot but warm when we asked about the fries being so dry and solid his response was wth i served plenty of fries to and made from making fries today had not had one complaint at all until now then hangs up what a waste and disappointment", "this was a great pizza we custom ordered pepperoni bacon and mushroom this is a thin crust almost cracker crust but it holds up a fantastic reminder for us of me n eds pizza in vancouver the toppings are cooked on top of the cheese providing a nice crispy ness to the pepperoni and doneness to the thinly sliced mushrooms i love crumbled bacon on pizza we do not have to be disappointed with other take out chain pizza places any more this is a great local shop worthy of lots of patronage looking forward to our next pizza", "great delish pizza i was not happy at the delay as they too phone orders ahead of me and did not apologize but the main asshole in charge actually shut his cakehole mouth and actually produced a decent pizza horrahhhh", "i finally checked this place out a couple weeks ago when i was driving home sort of past it its been on my list for a while but is pretty out of the way for the most part anyways i called ahead to order without incident arrived a little early so the pizzas were not ready yet its a pretty small shop so waiting is kind of sucky so try to arrive right on time in terms of quality it was a ok not the best pizza i have ever had not the worst not as outstanding as i hoped for based on some other reviews i found it to be a bit spicy for my tastes i could not figure out if it was the sauce or the pepperoni but i did really love the slightly chewy crust overall id go again if i was driving by and craving that type of pizza but i would not go out of my way across the city for it", "totally recommend other pizza lovers lots of toppings crispy thin and not oily pizza great customer service", "hands down the best pizza i have had the crust is perfect and i like thin but it does not bend with the million fresh toppings they use they have the perfect formula super friendly and good value when i have a cheat day this is where ill order from", "super fresh turns out this little neighbourhood pizza place in aspen gardens is the real deal they bring in and slice their own fresh vegetables make their own dough mix their own sauce grate their cheese fresh and they are happy to customize to personal preferences just tell them how you like it vegetables are fresh sliced and put on raw garden style nice sauce recipe i prefer saut\u00e9ed vegetables but its so nice to see they are fresh not out of a can owned and run by a family right in the neighbourhood with many of the staff walking or biking to work this is a new business just started in early and still working out some inconsistencies in their baking process mostly the quality and service are great quality and service have been very good on the three pizzas we have ordered there in the past couple weeks mostly a take out business but they do have a few tables for eating in this is definitely our new go to spot for pizza", "we tried the popeye pizza and it was very good the cheesy pizza bread however was only about half cooked definitely willing to give it another chance though its very close to my place so very convenient", "they claim thin crust although its a little thick to be true thin it is quite thin very nicely done good toppings and very very good my only suggestion would be to ask them to not put the wax paper under the pizza as it traps grease in rather than being absorbed into the cardboard do not get me wrong its not a greasy pizza just more than what i like will be back again", "unreal pizza ordered via skipthedishes it arrived hot and fresh crust was soft and tasty fluffy and not greasy toppings were fantastic and authentic soft cooked perfect crisp little grease never had such a perfectly baked pizza great texture and flavour", "tried this joint via skip the dishes when i wanted pizza but did not feel like the usual delivery options thin crispy crust and was not greasy at all sauce was flavourful just wish there was a tad more big fan of the amount of garlic in the pizza bread caesar salad dressing would definitely order again", "this neighbourhood pizza place in aspen gardens is the real deal they bring in and slice their own fresh vegetables make their own dough mix their own sauce grate their cheese fresh and they are happy to customize to personal preferences just tell them how you like it vegetables are fresh sliced and put on raw garden style nice sauce recipe owned and run by a family right in the neighbourhood with many of the staff walking or biking to work the quality is great and the commitment to customer satisfaction very unusual for a pizza place they have worked out the kinks mostly a take out business but they do have a few tables for eating in before stone wheel most of the pizza we ate was made at home now it seems our recycle bin is stacked with pizza boxes its the only place we go now for take out pizza", "this was a great little pizza place you can not really sit for a meal because there is only little tables and a couple chairs but we still ate in the pizzas are made right infront of you so you can see the cheese get piled on like crazy d the pizzas are fantastic crust has the perfect crunch and chewiness and not soggy try the garlic chicken or the fully loaded or custom make your own pizza you will not be disappointed if you have room they also serve ice cream or go next door to sqr for a coffee", "created our own pizza chicken mushrooms and red pepper for pickup pizza was ready as promised in minutes it was crispy fresh and very tasty it was not too greasy nor was it overly salty", "the stone wheel pizzeria is a little take out only pizza place in the southwestern part of edmonton there are no tables here but i think i saw some chairs for customers who chose to wait for their order my family was out of town and i did not feel like cooking so i ordered the greek pizza it was delicious they have found the right balance between famosa or rossa style of thin crust pizza both favourites but why does less crust cost more money and typical chain pizzerias that give you a huge white flour crust and capricious amounts of cheese in fact i suspect that the main reason i have said that most pizzas taste the same is because all that you can really taste is the crust and cheese not so at the stone wheel in fact they have managed to make a thin crust pizza that you can hold with your hand if you want to the three elements where all there crust fill cheese but all in the right proportions the toppings all tasted very fresh and i felt no guilt after eating it as its all good food service was very friendly and there were a lots of staff behind the counter for busier times the prices seemed to be a bit higher than necessary but then again pizza prices seem to vary widely in edmonton the price was not high enough to keep me away this is my type of pizza if my review describes the kind of pizza that you enjoy i would encourage you to check out the stone wheel pizzeria however if you judge a pizza by the amount of gooey cheese covering a thick huge crust you will might do better elsewhere and then head to the gym afterwards ill be looking forward to trying out other house specials when i get my next pizza craving", "we wanted to check out the new pizza shop down the street we ordered a large pizza half loaded and half garlic chicken the pizza was really good its thin crust and the loaded side of the pizza my side had a lot of fresh chunky veggies on top of it i think we found a new place to get our pizza from the customer service was good the two young men who were working there were very pleasant to talk to", "first time trying this place pizza is thin crust toppings are very generous and price was definitely reasonably for what i got we ordered medium was the loaded bacon pineapple yellow and red peppers mushrooms and a few different meats topped with a generous amount of cheese pie was a kid friendly hawaiian huge chunks of pineapple we are glad to have more than local pizzeria in the neighborhood mom and pop places like stone wheel are typical of what older neighborhoods need thanks brandy jonathan and family", "consistentley tasty with friendly service donairs burgers chicken strips and poutines all good fair price", "donair poutine is my staple i regretfully admit that i have not tried anything else even though i have been there numerous times the staff there is always warm and welcoming the food is delicious and they have got great portion sizes", "easily this place is the champion for donairs in edmonton along with swiss donair in north edmonton great service place is kept clean and the donair has an amazing taste and they are not shy with the meat been coming here for about years now and the recipe has not changed and will be loyal whenever i am craving one and in downtown area try one out you will not be disappointed especially for the price too cheers", "i checked this place as my friend drove there n took me along i also have a friend that visit often in another donair place compared to that one this place was quite clean and using lcd tv was some sort of expensive and surprising investment to showcase their menu i had roast beef which was little meat and nothing specialno arbysfriend for a burger combo and fish burgeragain all ready made food they probably buy from wholesale store to all those ignorant people who love donair you should know that all shops in edmonton buy their rolls from a factory it costs them about dollars and sell for a sandwich if you hang around in a donair shop you will know that it is not beef or meat at allits a pressed something perhaps meat and soyaand it is extremely greasy when at night they empty the tray its full of orange oil perfect for your diesel truckavoid these shops or stick to chicken for real shawarma or donair you must go to middle east turkey or some authentic arabic restaurant in us this canadian version is pure garbagealthough it is delicious stuff they leave behind in the sink stinksbeware", "horrible customer service when you first go there they supersize everything then as they see you more your servings get smaller they treat their friends coming in better then other customers one time i ordered the chicken donair and one guy said they had no more chicken literally the next guys that came in right after me were their friends and he made chicken donairs right there and served them before me leaving me still waiting another time i ordered a donair no lettuce and the guy put lettuce on but reassured me he did not and marked no lettuce on it and it was full of lettuce just recently i went to get a donair poutine and got home to find a regular poutine even after he charged me extra for sweet sauce that was not even on iti went back and instead of making me a fresh poutine he just put donair meat and sweet sauce on the fries i had brought back he did not even apologize for the mistake", "good shwarma the spicy tzatziki is excellent i would have given them one more star if they did two things i for people that eat in there is no reason to put the shwarma in a plastic bag and ii it would have been nice to have a box of fries rather than just putting them on the tray cover otherwise the food is great the staff is friendly and the prices are fair", "worlds finest donair so true their burgers are also delicious the sweet sauce is tasty too quick and tasty and nice staff members will be back for sure", "checked out this little place at yelps suggestion and it was great i got a small donair poutine and my husband got a donair meat was plentiful and tasty if not particularly remarkable was very quiet when we went in on a sunday night and we did not have to wait long very big portions good value", "well i have been back quite a few times and raised my rating to stars i have found them to keep a clean restaurant the front part anyway as the tables are always clean they are pretty consistent unlike other donair places where it seems it would depend on who is cooking on whether you should eat there and the best reason i discovered if its nice out and not too windy you can take your food across jasper th and go sit on a park bench overlooking our amazing river valley victoria park donairs were made for this world famous also has picnic tables on the side so an old school patio but the bench view is better", "hands down my favorite donair spot i have been lucky enough to live next door to this place for nearly a year now this place provides the ultimate comfort food in great portion sizes for a fair price as well as give me the option to season my fries with all seasoning sometimes if they have it they will throw in free mayo dipping sauce too the folks who work there and run the place are friendly and have been generous about giving my boyfriend or i free cheese on our donairs when we were short on cash i think this place is one of jasper aves best kept secrets and ill miss the convenience of these donairs big time when we move", "one of the best shawarmas i have ever had do not even think about it this is the place to eat", "went on a tuesday night around the place was clean and not overly busy when i was there the service was fast and polite on to the food that is why you are reading this right i got a super donair with cheesesweet saucetomato and fries and pop the pop can was cold and the fries fresh hot and surprisingly good the donair was pretty good and tasty big chunks of tomato but unfortunately it was not hot at all like barely lukewarm and i ate it as i walked home so its not like it was sitting around a while i would probably go back to see if the room temp meat was a one off if i was in the area update went back and the heat has returned every thing else same so much better hot", "worlds famous is not a place i would go to just for the heck of it however it is one of the few donair places i would go to late at night when some of the better options are closed its location on jasper ave makes it convenient after a night out when you are starving and do not want mcdonalds it gets kind of busy at night but it always varies i have found that the meat is sometimes overcooked and is too crispy and that just ruins it when it is not overcooked it is pretty good its not the best but gets the job done if you need food late night and are downtown then i would suggest checking it out do not go out of your way though", "this has got to be one of the messiest donairs in the city i usually go for donair poutine and they do it pretty good here this is definitely my go to donair place downtown though my true favourite is on the southside they have a lot of great fresh toppings including pickled turnip i think that is what he said it was i have not tried it yet but its neon pink so i am more than a little intrigued they cut their tomatoes smaller here than at most donair shops which i quite like i hate big tomato slices one small complaint that i have is that they leave their donair meat in long slices when used on the poutine maybe i have just been spoiled by my local shop but i really prefer when the meat is cut into smaller pieces before put on the fries the service is always really great they do not squirm or anything if you change your mind on what toppings you want and they are pretty quick even during the rushes i always take mine to go because i would rather make a fool of myself trying to eat it without making a mess at home and not in front of strangers but if you would prefer to eat there there is tables for you to choose from", "being a desi i always try foods that i used to find in south asia and uae i went to this outlet and tried their shawarma cheese burger and chicken nuggets everything was fresh tasty and prepared to perfection i wish that the bread they used for shawarma were softer but i liked everything prices are very reasonable sitting area is clean staff is friendly they have ample parking relative to the size of their business i highly recommend this place if you are looking for donair shawarma or home style burgers", "one star seeing as you can not give any less and this place deserves far less i live less than a block away and have been here more then a few times that said they really have no clue as to what they are doing get ready if you eat here for mistakes on your order when you eat out you expect a place that can deliver either a great experience or food or really both every time and all the time this place just can not do it and i really wish they could the food when they get it right is great but i just can not forgive the inconsistent service", "i have been there times and there are nothing so good or terrible about the restaurant the taste is good and price is fine for a king donair the only reason i go there because it was so close to my apartment", "la personne qui a appel\u00e9 ca world finest a vraiment mang\u00e9 peu de kebab dans sa vie sec acide et pas vraiment bon", "this is a ok place to get a donair the meat i believe is not made in house it has a bland taste to it i have gone here a couple times the staff are very friendly the donair wrap sub par the fries and the gravy tasted very good very spicy gravy which i like and why i gave three stars", "one of the best donair shops in town best sweet sauce there is have never been disappointed i will definitely be back someday", "absolutely great donairs very friendly staff great portion sizes as well they are open late as well on thursday friday and saturday open until am so it is great after you go out to the bar other days it is open until am great food and a great place to eat phone", "was there today and had the king donair with extra sweet sauce best donair i have ever had i have tried from vancouver to halifaxthis was the best and biggest no extra bs charge for extra sauce no attitude all super could not finish whole thing thanks will be back", "i found it to be a very dirty place not my cup of tea the food was not good either would not recommend and will not be back unless they get less creepy staff and some renovations and a better menu", "i love a good donair and worlds finest is one of my all time faves great sauce and perfectly spiced beef huge portions and lots of additional veggies for toppings if you want one of my favorites from here is the donair poutine its a game changer for sure staff is always friendly and the owner is one of those guys who never forgets a face or maybe i eat there too much", "my the mighty have fallen this place used to be a staple for me place is ok cleanliness wise but the donair meat and sweet sauce has gone downhill what happened guys it takes years to build a trust trust but one time to break it swiss donair is still the champion in edmonton", "i have been going to this place since it opened the donair they created is something that will keep you coming back for more i have tried a lot of good donairs but this by far is the best i travel from the deep north east in heavy traffic just to enjoy this deliciousness of amazing donairs i like swiss donair that is in my neck of the woods but i love worlds finest bar none the garlic in the meat is great the spice is on point and the dill sauce that i love is amazing always fresh ingredients used the texture of the meat and the tortilla is perfect please at least try this jem of edmonton and see for yourself how good a donair can be", "i love this place staff are always friendly service is great the food is fresh hit and oh so tasty", "worlds worst it was terrible tonight they did not care do not go here ordered a donair they stared at me and made a terrible donair not sure what to say normally pretty good", "this is probably my favourite donair place in edmonton never had a bad donair there and the prices are all very reasonable the meat is tasty with a good selection of toppings guys at the counter are always friendly and get your food out quick even when the place is pretty busy its also open really late which makes it a favourite spot for me and my friends for a late snack after a night out parking can sometimes be a little limited but otherwise not much bad to say about this place", "i am not a donair person the idea of meat meat and more meat crammed into a pita is not my idea of delicious i find donairs messy and difficult to eat and i have always wondered what is in donair meat until i started going to worlds finest then none of that really seemed to matter anymore now this place is not the prettiest of restaurants a handful of grimy looking tables harsh florescent lighting and chipped tile flooring but when you are looking for a good donair i do not really think the ambiance is what keeps you coming back the guys working behind the counter are funny and they know what they are doing the donairs are hot flavorful fresh and moist the veggies they include are all fresh and not nasty looking no brown lettuce or soggy tomatoes they have a custom made hot sauce that can make you sweat if you are into that kind of thing or if you are not they also have a wonderful tzatziki and an even better sweet sauce the nice thing about worlds finest is that its open super late into the evening so you can get your donair fix seemingly at all hours the pricing is cheap and they offer a variety of foods ill admit i have never tried the pizza the serving size is huge and they are pretty fast in making your order up fresh i have taken friends to worlds finest and converted them give them a try chances are you might agree that the name of the shop is pretty fitting", "this is my favourite donair shop so far in the fair city of edmonton we love to take a walk along the promenade to enjoy the sunset and then grab a donair here the prices are reasonable and the service is super quick these are some of the messiest donairs i have ever come across but so tasty you have the option of having the tzatziki or the sweet sauce there is plenty of meat and it is never dry the veggies are always fresh and if there is something that you do not want on it they can make that happen the staff is always smiling and friendly there is no table service you go up to the till to order and then your order is called out when it is ready i hear the poutine is pretty fantastic but have not had a chance to try it myself yet there is limited parking in front of the shop but i have never had an issue getting a spot if you are a pokemon nerd there is a lot of stops and pokemon available right across the street on the promenade that overlooks the river valley", "one of the best shawarmas i have ever eaten in edmonton i lucked out looking for a place to get a quickie i mean fast food for those with green minds and my yelp app listed this place as the only one that was cheap enough as i was driving around the vicinity of oliverst anyway the cook noticed i am not a regular and thanks me for coming to his restaurant i ordered the super chicken shawarma which i noticed was packed full with tons of chicken and veggies i was starting to salivate as i watched him put together the pita sandwich he even put the packaged shawarma on the grill for about more seconds to warm it up a bit more the shawarma was very good and flavourful and quite filling for only needless to say ill be returning to this place again for a tasty quickie next time ill try the sweet sauce", "the place has the ambience of a submarine however the price is great staff excellent hours superb and the food is good the burgers are to die for and the same price as a quarter pounder with twice the taste and value the donair and shawarma are also not bad portions are designed to fill a redneck stomach they have the prayer music running in the background which i find really nice", "after doing photo jobs i tend to treat myself with a greasy late night meal this time i was in edmonton and my hotel was near jasper ave walking down jasper saturday night there are not many choices on the west end of jasper i came across worlds finest donair after about a minute stroll walking in i noticed the usual atmosphere of a donair shop the greasy smell style less decor tv on the wall i was in the right place i ordered a regular donair and a pop sat down and watched the tv until my donair was ready the wait times are a bit slow id have to say the slowest i have ever encountered and they were not packed by any means minutes later i finally get my donair its exactly what i asked except it was packaged to go instead of to stay no big deal they put enough sweet sauce too the only place that actually has done it properly i am a sweet sauce whore all in all it was a good donair with a good price came out to less than with a pop friendly and good service minus the wait times id go back if i was in town and in the area again it would get stars if it did not take so long", "saw the reviews and decided to try it no room to park there but there is a small parking lot so kind of parked anyways and went in was a bout ish at night no line up and studied the menu small menu but seemed focused on donairs which i was there for so finally decided on a super i think for about bucks and change they had some tool for shaving the meat off the spit and then put it on the grill that part did not like so much as dried it out a little but they did cut a lot off for me big pita and loaded it up with onions and tomatos and cover it generously with sauce the donair was basically good and worth going in for but not brilliant will still be looking for a better one but when in the neighborhood will go back as to the place it was clean and bright seriously was there for the donair service was polite an clean as he kept washing hands there were tables to sit at but i got mine to go personal choice a good place to try and yeah love the hours they work for you not like some that think they doing you a favour by even being open so go try it it is decent and good food but just not the best i have had", "thick sandwiches stuffed to the brim with meats and veggies this is the donair shop you have been looking for all your life that you have dreamed about also the owner is really friendly and he gave us a bucket of cranberries one summer unrelated to restaurant service", "big portions for big eaters does this joint offer the very best fast food that i have ever had no it does not but its pretty darned good worlds finest is recommended if you are feeling cheech and chong hungry", "worlds finest continues to impress recommended if you are up for a donair the service they offer is friendly and the food is good for greasy grub all in all its better than most donair shops", "my personal favourite donair place in edmonton love the tzatziki sauce meat has excellent flavor fries are fresh can not beat it", "the pizza here is good and they have some interesting choices like triple bacon yum and one with chicken fingers i always call the store directly to order and avoid any confusion we also usually pick up because we live in a a basement suite in a new development with no street signs and every delivery guy has gotten lost they are good about calling for directions but its not that hard to locate the only bungalow on the street", "we are always happy with the service and product we receive from papa johns and today was no exception we got the large deal papas fav garden delight meats they typically come with a garlic sauce but i asked for them to be exchanged for the marinara or pizza sauce which she happily did for me the crust is lovely and there is a decent amount of toppings on every piece a great place for fast hot good food", "i have tried a south location and it was great i feel they skimped out on the cheese felt like a pizza offer where you expect to get what you pay for", "we ordered pizza and wings from skipthedishes and they were yum only negative is the delivery time on the order page it showed mins upon order confirmation it showed mins then it just keeps on getting delayed as i tracked the order all in all we waited hr mins for the order to arrive", "went here for the very first time today we did not know what to expect when we decided to go there it looks like a hole in the wall type of place and you can tell its only been open recently opened in december apparently however the food was really good the guy i am assuming the owner was very kind and helpful as well i think we kind of caught him off guard because he did seem a bit disorganized we figure maybe because we were well ahead of the lunch time rush andor because we were eating in there are two tables outside disorganization and aesthetics aside this is a good place to eat my suggestion is to call ahead about min with your order", "the best food finds actually come to me unplanned and its the best kind of surprise too like finding a bill in your pants my latest stumble my empanadas located right next door to the newly opened korean mama lees kitchen on st and ave earlier this week we had dinner there and as joe and i were walking out and making our goodbyes to jessica and jerry jessica of course spotted the argentinian empanada shop jessica has the biggest eye for food ten times larger than mine were we all full yes did we want to try empanadas yes so what did we do need i answer that the shop has been around for nearly two years now in fact i was already following it on twitter and had it on my wishlist on urbanspoon how many of these little eats have i completely overlooked a full menu is available on their website little slips of paper serve as a guide for when you buy your pockets of deliciousness they can be baked on the spot and served to you at one of their two tables or if you prefer you can order them frozen with full instructions to take home and enjoy between the four of us we ordered a chicken beef chorizo and pork hurray for sharing we all had room for one empanada in our stomach and with a bite of each one totally do able it took minutes for him to bake our order same time as the frozen varieties they came out piping hot and crispy my favorite the chorizo i always like a little bit of heat the pork and chicken had a sweeter marinade than the beef but all were delicious jessicas favorite was the beef i think we were all thinking the same thing but jessica was the first to say it should we buy some frozen ones for later yes so we did and this is where the menu slip is of extreme importance in order to differentiate the empanadas just match up which style it looks like excellent the owner even provided us with full instructions preheat oven degrees celsius egg wash for shiny appearance lay evenly and bake for minutes rotating sheet every minutes and parchment paper cute we all wanted to try the philly cheese but he was sold out of them what that really means is that its probably better than the ones we just had must order more definitely give my empanadas a go when you are in the neighborhood each empanada is only philly cheese and they also serve tortillas and pizzas", "we found this place totally by chance when passing by avenue its a small place and mostly take orders but it has tables outside awesome empanadas we tried different types and i liked the beef empanadas and spinach empenadas the best they were crispy tasty and more importantly had a touch of cumin which is one of my favourite spices the owner is very friendly and helpful i suggest to order by the phone before getting there it takes about minutes to prepare the empanadas", "many different kinds of empanadas its usually about per person to make a meal for an adult depending on how hungry you are we had different kinds in our order and all were delicious slightly expensive per person but very good chorizio is my favorite with the pulled pork right after will have to try their pizza mostly take out there is a couple tables in the place but not really for dining in will return", "its probably not fair to compare but i just came back from visiting buenos aires for a few days and myempanadas specializes in argentinian empanadas what better time then to compare now plus life is never fair so deal with it we checked out the small empanadas shop which is located right beside mama lees kitchen we were greeted by an empty counter so we rang the bell and waited for a couple of minutes interesting seeing as there was no one else there i also found it a bit odd how the owner has a white drapesheet to block off the kitchen why not keep it open so you can see all the empanada magic making happen anyways we were planning to go to dinner elsewhere so we just wanted to sample a couple of empanadas we ended up only trying seafood decent amount of seafood in this empanada ham and cheese pretty plain nothing special we were not impressed with this one for the price of empanada i was not impressed to compare a place i tried in ba that is known for their empanadas was charging empanada and they were stuffing their empanadas also there is no deal if you order one versus a dozen i asked so i can not really justify buying empanadas when i could get a full meal from mamas right next door essentially not bad but am i aching to go back debatable", "the empanadas are absolutely delicious and the owner is very friendly i get mine frozen and he makes sure i understand the cooking instructions i do not think i have ever had a bad flavor", "picked up empanadas a couple nights ago and all was great kids really liked the chicken mild and pork we also had the beef and chorizo and thought they were great took min and about for the its non descript on the outside but worth checking out we will definitely be back nice to support a local small business that takes pride in their food", "just had my first visit the empanadas are beyond my expectations warm and juicy for a very good price the owner is also very friendly i would suggest a pickup order since it takes quite a while to bake", "we read about my empanadas online and since we both love empanadas my boyfriend and i decided to try it right away so happy we did carlos the owner was super friendly and courteous the empanadas were amazing and very authentic to the argentine style i love that they are all baked and not fried we will definitely go here again and will also pick up some empanadas for any potluck that we have to attend so good", "how is this place not lined up at lunch in edmonton these empanadas were amazing i really enjoyed the chorizo and cheese and my wife liked the philly cheesesteak the jalepeno ranch dip was stellar friendly service frozen empanadas to take home and prices were fair", "first off all if there ingredients are top notch the empanadas are so awesome i have tried them all there is not one that i like better than then other the pizza is my favorite though the thin crust they used is excellent this is a must try restaurant", "i have tried almost every flavor of empanada these guys have all delicious service is super friendly location is even pretty convenient do not let the scary strip mall fool you come here eat order about mins ahead for quick pick up on your way home from work", "found this place through a link to a food delivery service via reddit we tried three kinds of the empanadas the chicken with olives raisins and onions the chorizo with potatoes onions and pimentos and our favorite the pulled pork my husband went to pick them up and had time to run an errand to the italian centre the restaurant suggested calling ahead minutes or so next time they were still piping hot when he got home the pastry was crispy delicious and not at all greasy the toppings were very flavorful without being too spicy for about ten bucks we had a nice change for a take out dinner we added some salad we had at home and we will definitely be trying them again interested in trying their pizza next", "tonight we were driving by and decided to give their empanadas a try the man i believe was the owner was very friendly and professional the place was kept clean and neat and the menu was easy to read our food arrived in a timely manner each empanada was we tried different kinds of empanadas beef chicken and philly cheesesteak they were made fresh and came out to us hot and yummy my favorite was the beef empanada dipped in hot sauce it would have been even tastier if there had been pico de gallo with it overall it was a good experience and we will be back to try the other kinds of empanadas", "wow these empanadas are good the pastry is doughy and with the right amount of fat and the interior of the empanadas are heavenly i do not know what the price was before but i was at myempanadas today and it was for an empanada except philly chesse i have tried most of their empanadas today and i highly recommend the smoked chorizo philly cheese steak beef and chicken empanada i tried different empanadas and enjoyed every empanada i had even the broccoli and the spinach ones although the seafood empanada could have used a tad more salt you can tell which ones are which by they cute shapes they come in id argue that these empanadas are far from one dimensional someone can take me up on that after you have had some unfortunately i was too obsessed with eating to take any pictures of the beautiful empanadas sorry one very important tip if you do not want to wait for mins is to order by phone in advance and you do not have to wait at all this is amazing if you are an impatient person like me i did wait mins though and it was worth it also if you arrive and there is nobody but a white screen and you have rung the little bell and you have said hellooooooooo a few times you can call the phone at the counter and that will be loud enough for someone to come out", "these empanadas are legit its so hard to find good ones in edmonton go here its a little hole in the wall but well worth a stop they seel them fresh or frozen just delicious", "sad to say this great little place appears to be no more the place is for lease and sitting empty", "awesome empanadas i would recommend the chorizo empanadas and beef empanadas make sure you set aside minutes to wait for them to bake the empanadas if you plan to eat there", "this is one of our go to pizza take out and delivery places we often order online and there has been a few times where it was not able to process the order and we had to call the store but most of the time its reliable they have coupons online you can look through and redeem the great thing is you can custom your pizza so if one person likes onions and the other does not you can ask for it to be on half of the pizza after you put the order though they give you a status bar so you can see the progress of your order and who is making and then delivering your pizza usually we get the regular crust but they also have thin crust and pan pizza but not in the large size and both are good the thin is nice and crispy and the pan is not too greasy the regular crust is not greasy on the bottom and not too dry either the last time we ordered they emailed a off pizza special for a week on online orders we got large specialty pizzas for of us and had leftovers for dinner the next day too they charge for delivery but our order was which i thought was a good price to feed all of us the delivery drivers are nice and we usually get our food in about minutes will continue to get pizza from this dominos", "dominoes oh how i have missed you i have very few negative things to say about this pizza chain as its been a favourite of mine for a decade that being said keep in mind for this review that this is the first time i have had dominoes for over a year and a lot can change we ordered using the app which was moderately well designed and organized loved that the coupon option was staring me in the face so i knew what my options were very quickly we both built our own pizzas i got ham sausage and pepperonilove meat and my bf got pepperoni bacon and mushroom original hand tossed crust for both and a side order of cheese bread delivery was normal length of time which is fine and expected pizzas were hot and yummy the reason i love dominoes is the crust its delicious soft bubbly and just epic i felt a bit cheated this time though as the crust looked more like a soft thin crust than hand tossed but maybe the recipe changed as it was like this on both pizzas and receipt said hand tossed so i was pretty disappointed but quality in the pizza was still the same garlic cheese bread was alright though it drives me insane that they do not cut it before delivery ever why i do not know garlic was not very noticeable and i would have much preferred mozzarella over cheddar with more garlic but hey all in all great food as usual definitely will bring my business to them love them", "i ordered online from a flyer i got in my mailbox large pizza with four toppings my order was accurate and fresh and arrived quickly and the delivery driver was polite and friendly i ordered thin crust with extra sauce and extra cheese and that is exactly what i got they were so generous with the extra sauce that next time i will not order extra there were plenty of toppings and i was pleased they use fresh mushrooms that were cut in thick slices the online ordering process was quick and easy with step by step instructions for accuracy i like the digital pizza that shows my order and once my order was placed i stayed on the same page because there was a bar showing where my order was showing when the order was placed the pizza was being prepped then baked then i was notified when the delivery driver was on his way overall i am pleased with the ordering process and the quality of the pizza and will order from here again", "one of the best dominos in edmonton makes wonderful pizza never disappointed highly recommend whoever makes pizza here and manages it deserves stars they have made me a long time customer specifically order pizza when i am on th st because i know it will be made well", "my mom goes there all the time and its delicious food tastes like a little bit off and burgers i do not like that much", "this is one of the better donair shops we have eaten at the donairs themselves were delicious very tasty large and filling they are not cookie cutter donairs maybe a step or two above what is typical the fries were good too i loved the way they served them on a piece of parchment paper right on the tray very clever we will for sure go back the place was steady when we went and even though there was only one guy working there at the time the food came out pretty quick the guy who served us was cheerful", "really nice spot to grab a donair excellent service and atmosphere food is so good my picky kids actually ask for a donair from here that is when you know the food is good you can call ahead and they will have it ready for you to pick up pizza is decent as well", "while renovating our nightmare condo we have popped into eddies times in the past month we have tried the cheese donair donair poutine chicken donair and onion rings the serving sizes are good the food is fresh and the quality is good still eddies will only make it to th or th place on my donair showdown list the good bright clean and open late no i mean really late am on frisat pm on week nights and pm on sundays another plus they are open for lunch days a week okay the bad our onion rings were so overdone that the insides were crunchy the onion itself the donair poutine was okay nothing to write home about they tend to overlook their foods in general i believe the food is fresh but when they pan frybrown the chicken before serving in the donair it was way too much the chicken was crunchy come to think of it the donair beef was a little over pantries today too the last two times were better the meats are seasoned excellently can not even put my finger on naming the seasoning on the chicken at the moment but it was good the store itself is bright and open with lots of table space its modern and clean def not your average donair hole in the wall they are located just off of ave nestled behind the esso next to a few other stores in a strip mall and their daily special is a regular don air pop for only check them out", "stopped into this little diner the other day eddies donair is your typical cookie cutter donair shop you find in all areas of town except this one is way on the northside i ordered a cheese donair garden salad poutine and juice i knew something was awry as soon as i spoke to the person behind the counter he had a hard time understanding what i was telling him about what i wanted to order and another person had to translate to him what i was saying this person seemed to be in a fog or lost or almost a complete newb when it comes to working in a restaurant and in a semi confused manner he put my order together the garden salad i ordered was the most pathetic excuse for a salad i have ever seen it was basically some lettuce with a few tomatoes and black olives on top a packet of italian dressing was included i imagine this is along the lines of what convicts in prison get for their salads the cheese donair was on the small side but the sweet sauce made it tasty and the poutine was made out of frozen crinkle cut fries you get from the supermarket nothing special here everything included total cost was i would go to a place like eddies before eating in the big franchisees like mcds or bk but really id make the extra drive and go some where else if i was craving a donair especially with all the great donair shops on the northside to choose from", "nice enough fellas if a little brusque but the donairs they serve are decidedly ordinary i do not understand the excitement about eddies donair pizza and i doubt very much that ill return there to try their donairs again meh", "one of the better donair shops i have eaten at in edmonton everything was fresh and the customer service was great i really liked the taste of these donairs i highly recommend this place and i will be back", "this place is usually pretty busy staff are friendly and the food is good when i crave a certain type of pizza bread y greasy ish saucy nothing with fancy cheeses or thin crusts hollywood pizza is awesome the prices are really cheap especially if you pick up a large topping for bucks there are two booths to eat in but its more of a take out place while you are waiting for your food there are two old arcade games and teen magazines from the sthe inside is warm from the ovens and smells like pizza i have only ever had the pizza but last time i was there some folks ordered the hot pizza subs which looked amazing the menu also has things like baked pastas donairs fried chicken wings and so on basically the whole set up is a stoners delite in my opinion there is also a laundromat next door and then you are just a short jaunt down the road from a gorgeous lookout of downtown and the river along strathearn drive so if you are planning a unique night out nothing beats doing a load of laundry grabbing a pizza and eating it while watching the sun set right", "these guys are hard working immigrant family that run the shop food is consistently good very clean and very good customer service do not hesitate to check it out", "did not wash his hands after taking my money and giving me change and used his bare hands to make the donair", "okay so i might be a little biased but i love this place i literally live about twenty paces from the front doors and do my laundry next door all the time it has that wonderfully buttery and thick crust lots of sauce real cheese that pulls about a foot long when you grab a slice and its dirt cheap you will not be disappointed in this pizza joint normally i am a fan of places like famoso or some good old homemade business but this is honestly my go to greasy joint speaking of i think i need some laundry washed", "my friends told me about this gem of a place i decided to try it one night mindblown this is by far the best pizza i have ever had also you can not beat the price bucks for a large pick up the crazy bread is addicting whatever they put in their special sauce i fear it may be meth is incredibly delicious like i have eaten there out of the last four days i am not sure ill be able to stop any time soon the fatter i get the more i can ultimately eat so all good i also tried the super donair yesterday also fantastic its an awesome little place in an awesome little neighbourhood a toke in the valley and some awesome soul food sounds like a good night to me", "hollywood pizza has been around for years in the strathearn neighborhood and have always kept their pizza affordable and tasty they also offer baked lasagna and spagehetti with ceaser salad as well as pizza subs that are very tasty they have many different varieties of pizza and many of which i have tried have been very good for the price the food gets to you fast and is always hot and ready to eat", "this place is the best love the pizza spring rolls and the hollywood hot submarine reasonably priced always hot and fresh i have been eating here for years and now drive all the way from the north side to pick up food from here totally worth the drive best pizza in edmonton", "quick service the pizzas are delicious pizza sauce does not give heartburns the prices have been awesome lately due to specials i always stop by in person for my orders and longest time i waited was minutes", "gluten free pizza is pretty decent the toppings are pretty skimpy almost need to our double ham double pineapple there is only one size of gf pizza but compared to bps pizza panago this is very tasty the crust might be thin but does have some chew", "tonight was the th time we ordered from this location every single time our order has been right hot when it arrives and delivery is quick they also have nice delivery drivers tracy has made our food the past times and it has been excellent we look forward to ordering again", "i love dominos whether its pizzapastaor wings they are hands down my favorite pizza chain restaurant in the city not only do they have great specials but there is also a rewards program where for every points accumulated you can get yourself a free pizza where this place loses stars for me is the fact that sometimes the service is spotty for instance we waited well over an hour for our order once and when it finally did get here they did have a valid reason for the delay but we could not get ahold of the store on the phone i was also displeased with the fact that the food was stone cold but we were never offered a discount on it and it tasted terrible when we got it when everything goes off without a hitch its five star amazing but we have had one too many experiences with delayed orders for me to give that five stars at this day and time", "one of the best places on campus for a hot lunch nothing beats a fresh relatively healthy pizza between classes they will set you back about but its filling and better than most take out they have not updated a thing in the restaurant since they opened i am sure i have been eating here since the early s but the pizza makes up for it", "oh the memories of heading here between classes to enjoy a personal size fresh hot pizza i would always get the vegetarian one which was loaded with cheese mushrooms green pepper and other toppings the prices are still reasonable for freshly made food and the places also sells chicken and pasta the best thing is that academy pizza is actually like a little restaurant where you walk in and are totally separate from the rest of hub mall it gets packed at lunch time and for good reason service is quite fast you place your order at the counter get a number and go pick it up when your number is called academy pizza is like an institution at the university just about everyone has a story to tell about it mine involves embarassing a friend i was having lunch with by serenading her with a jethro tull song she hates jethro tull anyways if you happen to be on campus and want something hot quick and fresh go here first", "academy pizza is one of the better places to eat in the hub mall over at the university of alberta i like eating here because it actually has a large sitting area unlike most of the places in the hub mall large by hub standards at least i always feel claustrophobic while eating at the hub because it is so damn narrow and there are not many seats in the hallway the pizza is greati might put it up there with the likes of famoso and royal pizza but that is a big might", "there is a baseline about visiting a boston pizza and this one matches those expectations been a couple times both using the lounge and have found the service fairly good and know you will be able to watch some sports while visiting with your friends my last visit i made a poor choice for food i know i am not a fan of their pasta however decided to go with the chicken and mushroom fettuccini maybe should have got the extra cheese since i struggle to call the bland and runny liquid the pasta came in a sauce dumb me i ignored myself and paid the price that probably will not stop me from going back it works well as a stop when coming north from south common on a friday night when you do not want to figure out which south common restaurant might have space since there is a cross street th ave from gateway it also has a large and easy to navigate parking lot and is that much closer to home when i leave", "not a huge fan of their sandwiches or pizzas but i do rather enjoy their salads i had the mexican salad and it was good the garlic bread it comes with is horrendous though its drenched in butter but the salad was tasty and filling", "what can i say this is a pretty standard boston pizza location we visited it most recently on valentines day to have heart shaped pizza valentines in the restaurant part was intensely busy so we ate in the lounge and the pizza was hot and fresh and delicious i wish it were more intuitive to find the restroom in the lounge but otherwise my most recent visit here was pretty standard when it comes to eating at boston pizza locations standard food decent service sometimes slow in this case but the restaurant was rather busy and the nice touch of being able to have heart shaped pizza", "i have been to other bp locations just not this one yetbut last friday i was out and about and got hungry fast it was only around on a friday but toni romas kitchen was already closed so i came here the place was dead i do not know if the restaurant was closed but no one was in therei sat in the lounge and there were a couple people sitting at the bar and a table or two with small groups eating it was quiet for a friday night but my hunger was the next order of business the waitress came by took my beer order and went to get a menu i looked at the menu and there was a new item on there steak and prawns so i ordered that i also ordered a side skewer of shrimp my food came within minutes and it was yummy i would come back here again and try the same new menu item i think this location has some real promise and probably has a steady stream of business but their weekends are dead from some of the other reviews i read i was concerned that they only had one server and bartender working the whole lounge but they were really dead and my service was still excellent so i tipped more that average that night i would like to come back when they are busy with customers and checkout the service then but the food and prompt service was above average", "took my friend from vancouver there last night we decided to hit the lounge as the blue jays were playing and we thought it would be a fun atmosphere our server joanna was great they were slammed and she was calm and never made us feel rushed at any time i ordered the brussel sprout salad and my friend had the french onion soup and chicken wings which were the smallest wings id ever seen lol food was great and came in a timely manner id come back again for sure", "decided to stop by for a quick bite i always stick with my favorites thai chicken and garlic cheese toast yum yumm the chicken has a perfect crisp exterior with a good amount of meat and the sauce is on spot the garlic cheese toast is everything it should be cheesy garlicky and delicious my hubby got the pizza burger and he was not a fan of it due to the way the burger is cooked it does not get that charbroiled flavor or feel its more like a boiled burger and not sure exactly how well pizza goes with a burger his sweet potato fries were good and the sauce was awesome the waitress was friendly the service for food was a little slow despite the restaurant being near empty at this time of the day the pricing is average not too high not too low overall i had a good experience by husband was a bit disappointed but that is what happens when you take a gamble on trying a new dish", "stopped by the lounge today for a late lunch with a friend the server was very friendly the right amount of attentive and quick with drinks the food and prices at bps are nothing special regardless of location and this one was no different the food was good enough the bill was about per person the usual", "i have ordered for delivery from here before the delivery person has always been very polite quick however the same can not be said for pick up i dropped in to pick up an order and waited a good minutes before i was even acknowledged not even a polite acknowledgement of hello or how can i help you more of a blank stare in my direction the food was ready i paid leaving with no bidding of have a good day or come again even food as always was good not sure if i came on an off day or what but i am willing to give them another try but rather dining in for the full experience", "your hungry and still do not know what you want come to bp they have a good variety of choices pasta pizza sandwiches and more food is okay service is good and a great family ambience", "i disagree with the other poster i have been to this bps several times to watch ufc ppvs and have had an excellent experience every time out the food is always excellent here and it always comes out relatively quickly which is impressive considering how busy the ufc nights can be at this location the servers and bartenders have great customer service and come around to refill my drinks or check how your food is many times during the night the restaurant has big screens over the bar itself and smaller screens throughout the rest of the place to catch the action the washrooms here are bright and clean and they pump the sound from the event into the washrooms so you can catch the audio even if you have to do a or the clientele at this bps are good too very few trouble makers low lifes or assorted riff raft in this bar the partrons for the most part are well mannered respectful of each other and well educated on the fights although when the alcohol sets in during a high stakes main event it can get loud one tip if it is a popular ufc event like when gsp or brock lesnar is fighting get there early to get a seat or even a parking space because the bar does put a sold out sign when its full better yet book a reservation a few days earlier this bps is a great place to watch the ufc or any other sporting event and i highly recommend it", "this is probably my favorite boston pizza in the city its the busiest one i have been to but the operate great under pressure because its busy there is a different atmosphere its good its always buzzing and it gives the whole place a trendy feel the servers here are usually always on top of their game they have to be the food is usually good and everything is pretty quick i do not remember having a bad experience here so if you are looking for a good boston pizza this is the place to be", "my boyfriend and i were super hungry and dropped by this bps to our surprise it was dead mind you it was a monday and about pm regardless we got seated right away the server was great above average from what i am use to at bps food was good pretty standard food i am a huge fan of cactus cut potatoes and they were fresh and yummy had pasta it waswell pastagood i did not eat much of mine but packed it to go to enjoy tonight would i come here again yep", "this wonderful canadian restaurant was founded in edmonton in the s so naturally i had to dine at bp while on my great canadian road trip lot parking was available and ample upon entering the restaurant we were seated promptly after much perusal of the menu our table ordered the cactus cut potatoes spicy perogy sic pizza pepperoni and bacon pizzaburger prime rib burger and meateor pizza the appetizer cactus cut potatoes were delicious they are a hybrid french fry potato chip creation with a bit of spice built into the potato itself i was reminded of a less crispy spicy persian tadig we enjoyed the potatoes for entr\u00e9es my brother and i shared the spicy perogy pizza and the pizzaburger both dishes were fabulous of the two i suppose i would give the edge to the pizzaburger because of its uniqueness we also tasted the meateor pizza which was a very impressive meat lovers pizza i was pleased with the service at this establishment our server christian was friendly attentive and personable the customer service tonight was top notch recommendations consider ordering something unique to bp such as their original specialty pizzas or the pizzaburger gravy for fries if you are very sensitive to spicy food skip the cactus cut potatoes for those who can tolerate mild spice you will probably handle the heat well verdict good food good customer service canadian beef and good flavours add up to a pleasing experience id be happy to return", "real good service thoughtful for an out of towner when i came to pick up just a min walk fr hotel staff threw a bunch of cutlery wet naps as usual their wings are great like the setup here booth seats parallel to kitchen and main area in front", "so in this context i came here on a busy wednesday night there were multiple large parties at this location service wise it was lacking at our table we got the bare minimum of getting our beverages our order and the bill first off for our beverages we just ordered water our waters were never refilled even though our server walk past our tables multiple times next our order was great until we never recieved our salt and pepper wings getting the bill was easy as it felt like they rushed us to leave the food here was standard its what you would expect from a boston pizza the place was also clean as well would i come back here if there was no other place open", "well i went to calgary trail bps to watch the last ufc fights and i was less than impressed by the service they charged the standard to get in and watch the fight that was fine when we ordered tea and pop our server was less than impressed but i was by the door and they kept opening it so i was freezing its funny though because our bill was higher than the majority of the bills in there because we had appetizers dinner and dessert and everyone else was drinking the jugs of beer that were on special i can not stand it when servers give attitude because they do not think they will make money off you i am a server i know how it is but i do not write people off at first glance i was a bit offended by the whole thing she did not say anything but the bare minimum to us and she gave us attitude the whole night the food was good my boyfriends stromboli was burned and not as good as usual but my spinach salad and pizza were delicious i was not impressed with the night overall", "i went to this bp location twice one time in the restaurant and the other time in the lounge and both time we had a very bad experience the servers has bad attitude i like bp but i am not going to this location again", "dallas pizza has been around for years and is an excellent family run business they have deep dish style pizza that has a lot of toppings and is an excellent deal for the money for the most part the service that i have received while being at dallas pizza has been excellent i can not comment on anything other then the pizza because i have not ordered any of the other items i would also rate this place as very kid friendly the parking lot is quite narrow so if you have a big truck or something of the like be careful when parking", "my hubby and i tried this for the first time last night and thoroughly enjoyed the pizza and spaghetti only complaint is have is the spaghetti came baked with cheese which i had not requestedstill yummy but i was looking for something less cheesey pizza crust was delicious not too doughy thin and crispy lots of toppings too i would definitely try this again and highly recommend to anyone for a casual pizza night", "went on a whim before rehearsal last night based on other reviews here on yelp sorry gang mediocre at best za was ok service was lacking would i go again maybeif i am in the neighborhood and not in any kind of a rush highlands pizza is just on the other side of the river and although its been a long time id go there first", "hands down one of the best pizza joints i have tried in edmonton the cheese is amazingly gooey the sauce is not too overpowering and the crust is crunchy and delicious i have never had a bad experience at dallas and i do not anticipate one although based on some of the other reviews sounds like i am not as picky with places like this you definitely have to try this place", "this is place is on the way home from work so we go often i almost always have pizza because it is the only non thin crust pizza i actually like in fact the donair pizza with homemade tzatziki sauce is very good have tried other things like the steak sandwich which was good and my son likes the baked pizza sandwich if a reuben sandwich is the special order it and enjoy what sets this place apart from the chains is the great staff always friendly sometimes a little cheeky which for me is a good thing and the consistent quality food", "i have never has pizza that looks like the photo on their website from dallas pizza and lately its been dry and over cooked", "i was introduced to dallas pizza by a few coworkers because it was close to our office and while everyone at my office seems to love dallas pizza i unfortunately do not so much its not even that there is anything particularly wrong with the food or the pizza i just do not love it the way other people seem to i have tried a couple of things off of the menu pizza salad and pasta but i just do not think its anything special and i am never left thinking good god that was delicious the restaurant and whole experience in and of itself also is not magnificent i have always found the service to be kind of slow and the staff to be less than pleasurable they have never been rude or mean but they also do not come off as warm and inviting either the decor is kind of old and looks like a restaurant from the s and i am not sure how often things get cleaned for example they store their high chairs by the bathrooms and i noticed the trays had a bunch of dead bugs on them like i said from the start a lot of people seem to really like dallas pizza but it just does not really float my boat i guess i guess its probably worth a try to formulate your own decision though", "still the best dad has passed and mom still runs it with the family sorry but i have eatin here for years and i am going to in the top for pies in town they have been in the same loyal place for years and the excellent quality is still the same still the same excellent pizza i grew up with and lovethey are worth the drive check them out you will not be disappointed", "well i have been living across the street from here for like a year then i was like i am going to try iy the pizza is fantastic i satrated mentioning to other people and they were like yeah i can not believe that place is still open because its been around so long so they went and well nothing but great news the pizza is so thick its awesome the staff is the friendliest bunch of people i hvae ever meet food prep is fast i seriously have nothing bad to say about this place if you go get the ham and mushroom pizzathe best", "well i moved back to this neighbourhood on the weekend and was excited to be back within walking distance as i was unpacking i got a little hungry i ordered the ham and mushroom and just as good as ever hit the spot dead on still good be there", "giving this place two stars in advance for the pizza waitress was rude we ordered ice tea and we saw the waitress literally mix good host ice tea in warm water and serve it to us we ordered two shots of tequila and were served triple sec gross called her out in it and she basically called us liars then eventually admitted it yikes hope the pizza is good go to capital pizza", "heard great things about this place went for the first time today average age of the customer is between and ordered the steak sandwich st try cold steak and peas offered to fix and that was microwaved again so my rare steak was well done this was the worst steak sandwich i have had in edmonton in years never going back again", "this place is very close to where i live and very tasty as well it has been around forever and it still crowds gather their prices are fair and the food is always tasty pizza is always fresh and delicious they have some fantastic creations as well if you are a gravy fan this is the best place for it anyways a local favourite so if you do not want to wait then show up early especially on the weekend thumbs up here", "be careful when ordering from these crooks ordered a xl meat pizza with extra cheese and added bacon they did not give me a total over the phone it was the delivery guy who thought they made a mistake when the bill was for one pizza he called to confirm and they did confirm they charged for extra cheese and for bacon there was maybe slices of bacon cut up and put on the pizza after some more back and forth i told the delivery guy he might as well just take it back because over for extra cheese and bacon was ridiculous he then insisted that i just give him and take the pizza reluctantly i did the pizza was good but not by any means worth that kind of money to cover all bases they do have the extra topping charges at the very bottom of the menu i looked after so bad on me for not checking thourly however any establishment that thinks is ok to charge an extra for slices of bacon and for extra cheese and not tell a person up front should be ashamed of themselves stay far away from this place", "wonderful i chose that as the first word when i bit into the fresh baked handmade pizza had this for lunch the office we called and ordered for pick up half hour later we had a dallas special pizza fresh out of the oven fooo and it was wonderful my co workers wolfed it down and i managed to taste pieces of the pizza it was almost too hot to eat at first good and the right amount of cheese to topping ratio will definitely order again and again and again", "disclaimer i have never actually ate in the restaurant i have only gotten take out i have had to wait in the restaurant though and it has a very s small town vibe going on now my partner loves the pizza here and it is good a ton of cheese and a zesty sauce the crust has a great crunch and they cut it in squares so there are some delicious corner crunchy pieces i have noticed that the quality of the pizza has gone down this past year my partner wants to eat this pizza at least every few months so i have seen this first hand last weekend we got a pepperoni and mushroom pizza to go it was ok but what really turned me off were the mushrooms it was like an entire layer about a millimeter thick of canned mushrooms all over the entire pizza under the cheese it sogged the whole pizza down this would possibly be different if we ate it in the restaurant in short way better than pizza hut or pizza but there are so many better pizza places in edmonton", "good pizza great staff no hair nets pricey but worth it love the food pizza as always is to die for", "oh boy this is one of those places that has been there for a hundred years serving the same kind of mediocre food to the same clients for decades upon decades this is the type of place you take your parents this is the type of place where the kids rave about the food while you and your spouse give each other the side eye on the drive home that said their pizza is a calorie busting wonder layers of delicious cheese packed upon piles of meat makes for a waistline regrettable indulgence with which i can not find fault if you are looking for something to tantalize your tastebuds while the kids make you sit through the fifteenth viewing of hotel transylvania the paycheck of adam sandler then you get yourself to dallas pardner", "so i have not yet tried the famous pizza of dallas but i do not have much interest in doing so based on my experience of the other food i think i know what ill get and it does not hold much appeal to me dallas pizza and steakhouse is part of a dying in the urban setting anyhow breed of ubiquitous restaurants i can only describe as small town alberta or maybe rural prairie because they are all over saskatchewan too and interior because we had a place just like this in my own small hometown run by a lebanese family who were my neighbours dallas is run by a greek family clean and run with pride good for a fancy night out with grandma its a working mans style pizza and steak joint which is to say very western style with huge portions heavy dressing and lots of meat and cheese better than a greasy spoon in that its clean and not totally cheap but kind of akin to an alberts with better seats and upholstery faux stained glass between booths big curtains printed wallpaper you get the picture i was not that hungry so i just had french onion soup pretty watery and tasteless not that surprising my bf had a lasagne which was a step above chef boyardee in quality and taste ie teeny bits of suspiciously textureless meat drowned in an oddly sweet tomato sauce and unbelievably drowned in cheese food to have a coronary to or a corona more on that later we shared a regular size greek salad that was greek salad with a lot of lettuce not the amount of veg one might like again very small town western tons of dressing drowning what must have been an entire head of iceberg lettuce it was huge the server commented that it was smaller than usual lots of feta and more than one legit kalmata olive not cheaped out very appreciated the best beer they had available was corona the server was not very attentive she sat in a booth folding pizza boxes most of the time and did not offer water refills or another beer for quite some time service was slow not dirty not lousy but not good old school food with below average service meh i am not keen to try it again maybe if someone else pays and i can bring my own beer", "amazing pizza can not be beat in my opinion is a bit more pricey but its a family owned restaurant so you got to expect its more expensive than a chain restaurant the servers are nice a lot of them have been there for years we do not often order from dallas but it certainly is a treat when we do we also get some kind of pizza and are never disappointed with the results in closing i suggest this pizza to all of my friends and consider it the best pizza in the city by far", "i had a wonderful experience at blaze pizzas newest location in sherwood park i got a build your own pizza which was fun to create and it only takes seconds in their fire oven to cook my favourite part was the wide variety of toppings to work with great service friendly staff i will definitely be back again looking forward to trying out more pizza combos", "great quick place to go for lunch prices are decent but the spicy pizza sauce is what will have me coming back great addition to the emerald hills area", "great pizza gluten option was delicious gluten tastier than daughters regular dough if you ask me fast service with many options for toppings whatever your taste a pizza you can create staff courteous friendly and efficient love love that calorie count is blatant thank you for a great meal", "good donairs i like the romain lettuce and big tomatoes pickled radish is a good idea but too salty for my taste regular donairs are big as other places supers would be interesting to see some other veggies available", "this used to be my absolute favourite donair place in the city huge donairs awesome sweet sauce i recently went back after not going in about a year and i am wondering if it is under new ownership the donairs were half the size they were before and they were cold so disappointing as we drove out of our way to come here specifically i ranted and raved to my husband about these donairs and that it was worth the extra drivei feel like an idiot now", "by far the best donairs in the city always fresh and yummy could not say much about the rest of the items on the menu only because i am a donair aficionado staff are friendly and the place is always clean", "i have been to this place several times over the years and its always fresh and really good so filling too love me some of that sweet sauce i also tried the donair poutine that is good too and add tzatziki sauce on that", "my favourite donair in the edmonton meat is well spiced veggies are always fresh and the sweet sauce is amazing recommend this spot to anyone who is looking for a good donair incredibly friendly staff as well", "finally a donair restaurant that rivals charles smart i drive for there donairs from calgary they are the best", "definitely edmontons finest donair the d\u00e9cor is old but within it lies an edmonton donair gem my husband had an apartment across the street it was late i was hungry and we had not picked up any food yet we started to think what might be open and thought of worlds finest donair it was right across the street after all he ran out to pick up drinks from the liquor store next door and what would be the first of many worlds finest donairs consumed in our household the donair was hot the wrap delicious and inside was an overflowing amount of wonderful donair meat with bright fresh vegetables and a sweet sauce like i have not ever tasted this turned us into big donair fans trying just about every donair shop we have passed in edmonton and our second and third place favorites change regularly worlds finest remains our donair we have since moved and my late night worlds finest donair cravings continue even if it means going for a drive", "this is hands down the best donair spot in the city i am kind of glad to not live close by anymore because i could honestly eat there at least once a week its definitely worth the drive though from anywhere in the city i am going to go there tonight lol", "well i do not often get donair i am still in alberta girl which means there is definitely going to be a donair or two somewhere sometime world famous gets my vote because guy that runs the place is super friendly and always has a smile on his face he does not mind when you asked for requests like sweet sauce on the side or for a kids size donair the flat bread is fresh and plump i also prefer chicken donair at times and theirs is awesome then the true test do they have tzatziki sauce and does it rock yes and yes", "top notch fresh generous portions i do not know if its the worlds finest donair but it def gets stars delicious", "i visit my sweetheart in edmonton from california and i make him take me here we do not get donairshawarma here stateside so its a huge treat properly done perfectly seasoned meat shears off of their meat wheels and pair beautifully with their fresh veggies and wholesome flatbread mounds of crisp fries accompany this and the whole thing sets you back by not very many dollars make a pilgrimage here you will see", "worst donair i have ever had ordered a super and it looked like a kids donair what little meat there was was dry and over cooked worker was not wearing a mask and did not seem to be following covid protocol would not recommend or return as customer again", "this place is amazing everytime i have something from here its better than the last time staff is super friendly and provide great service my go tos are super donar with cheese or donair poutine the chicken shawarma is also pretty good", "definitely one of the top donair places on my list but again if i could frankenstein this bad boy with marcos or something it would just dominate the donair world not only is it great but it does not make you feel like you are months pregnant after eating it the meat itself top notch the veggies are fresh and crisp the sauce is obviously amazing and the ratio of all of these are absolutely perfect but my only complaint is that the pita is way too small but like i said if you are okay with some donair on your hands and face then this is fine for you for those of us who want to stay at least half presentable after destroying one of these guys it might not be ideal regardless of that i still think this place gets a star any day its fast service and you can see them making it so you know everything is fresh the onions rings i really enjoyed and a small portion is a good amount so i would recommend that if you plan to pair it with a donair their hours are great and all in all its a place you need to check our if you are having a hankering for the wonderful pita goodness that is a donair", "a friend introduced me to this place id never had a donair or anything like it in my life and i became hooked its a nice little place with great food nice staff and easily accessible highly recommended", "in the dark ages i used to visit this location when it was a mr submarine when worlds finest moved in i took notice but did not visit as i already had a go to donair spot about a decade ago i moved into the oliver neighbourhood and one night i decided to give them a go i was curious to see if they could live up to the name my first experience was excellent the service was quick and friendly and the donair was generous juicy and delicious the fellow behind the counter put it together nicely and gave me a big smile when i shooed away the sweet sauce in favour of the tzatziki sweet sauce is a strictly canadian failing and the main reason haligonians claim to have invented a dish that originated in turkey centuries ago doner is turkish for turning meat but i digress since then i have returned numerous times and have yet to have a bad meal the convenience and the portions are my main selling points as i believe there is better donair in edmonton but i am never disappointed if i had to offer a single criticism it would be that their fries and onion rings could use some work but this is also the case with all of the donair shops i visit if one of these places could learn the dark art of deep fry they would rule so not worlds finest or even edmontons finest but damn good all the same the restaurant is clean as are the washrooms the staff are courteous and efficient and the food is excellent if you are downtown looking for some rotating protein goodness give worlds finest a spin you will not be disappointed", "solid but far from finest had some free time at the dinner hour and was in the downtown area had to scratch another shop off my list nice little place off jasper ave store is busy which is a good sign parking is limited staff are friendly service was a ittle slow they could use one more person in peak hours as the two that were there had trouble keeping up prices are a little steep at for regular super and king resectively i went with the middle option no cheese onions lettuce tomato and of coursesweet sauce i also ordered a cup of garlic sauce in the side to my surprisewhen i finally got my orderthe side sauce lookedand indeed tasted like taziki i approached and questioned the staff as i had specifically requested garlic sauce they now decided to tell me they do not have garlic saucebut there is garlic in the taziki not the end of the worldbut i feel this can not be the first time this has come up and it would have been nice to have been informed of this detail when i ordered oh well the donair meatgoodand well seasoned the best part of the meal pitaaverage veggiesfesh and flavorful enough sweet saucei could barely see taste or find it maybe i should have ordered a side of this really disappointed in this sauce garlicerahtaziki saucedecent but not garlic sauce valuehigher prices for middle of the road fare all in all ok if it were my local shop i could work with it extra sweet sauce would be a must but i would still shop around for a better deal certainly not the worlds finest", "we do not have a papa johns in my neighborhood so this is our next closest one we have come here approximately times now they always have a special but the mediums for or extra for large pizzas is their best deal by far you can select from any of their specialty pizzas or create your own up to toppings our favorite is the pepperoni and meatball with extra wait can you guess it pepperoni meatball ding ding gold star okay i have been watching too much toddler television but seriously try it papa johns also includes a dipping sauce garlic buttermmm except that its not real butter and banana peppers with every pizza i find the order time at this location is not the same as what they say on the phone but after being frustrated for waiting minutes instead of the quoted minutes the last time i spoke with the manager who advised me that it is a call centre that takes the orders and gives quotes for pick up rather than the individual store that is all fine and dandy except when you have two kids in the car and one is a baby who screams and cries bloody murder when the vehicle is not moving i think good customer service would have warranted a discount for waiting an extra minutes or a comment that they would be providing the feedback to corporate about the timing issue when the call centre gives a blanket pick up time of minutes rather than utilizing a system that allows for individual store pick upwait times glad papa johns has made the trek across the border and we will continue to frequent them for last minute toddler approved meals ps this is a take outdelivery location only no on site dining", "its a little casual restaurant with good food i highly recommend trying it my daughters and i have eaten there many times and we always look forward to going back", "i really regret not finding this place sooner do not be fooled by the exterior this is more of a take out place on our way to do shipping in italian center we saw this little restaurant with a genuine hole in a wall vibe the specially here is empanada but they also serve pizza we tried different types of empanadas my favorites were traditional beef spinach and the ham and cheese it is obvious that everything is made from scratch the dough is crispy and tasty the fillings our extremely flavorful i really enjoyed the use of spices like cumin the chef somehow managed to transform the usually boring spinach filling to a very tasty interesting empanada they also give you a cheat sheet so you can identify the empanadas each empanada has a unique shape and somehow made the dining experience more interactive you can also buy them frozen and bake them at home which is something that we will defiantly do in future it is perfect for a lazy day most of empanadas are and they are not small at all in my opinion the price is very reasonable for the portion size they bake the food to order which is a big positive for me but as it takes around minutes if you are in a rush call them ahead of time and the food will be ready as soon as you arrive", "tonight was my first time eating here and it was a very good experience i had three empanadas chorizo cajun pork and beef the cajun pork was good and had a sweetness to it but the chorizo tasted better so far that one is my favorite i did not eat the beef empanada because i was getting full so i took it home i think the empanada diagram given to us with our meal was a good idea i did not know which empanada was what until hubster pointed out that each empanada is shaped differently and to look at the diagram i really liked the empanadas at myempanada the crust was crunchy and the filling was hot and savory i also found the owner to be very charming i am definitely coming back to to try the other empanadas before we left the hubster made sure to get four more chorizo empanadas this time frozen so we could bake them at home", "note that this review is based on the new location i believe that all previous reviews were written when my empanadas was located futher east the present location is in a house in the totally residential neighbourhood of royal gardens the house is being renovated but i saw nothing to suggest that the renovations were related to the food business as a result there is no seating you must phone ahead to place your order and the owner will assemble the order and have it available for you for pickup he said for orders of or more empanadas he will cook them for no extra charge however you must still pick them up or use one of the delivery services such as skip the dishes i did not know this so i phoned him while i was parked out front i bought a bag full of empanadas honestly i forgot how many i actually bought there are filling including that are vegetarian i bought beef chicken chorizo broccoli and spinach each kind is marked with a symbol or shape that helps to identify it once i got home i pulled two out and baked them at for around minutes he even provided me with parchment paper for baking them one definitely is not a meal but if you are not too hungry two would be quite nice for a lunch its really hard to rate this business because it is closer to a grocery store than a caf\u00e9 however i did enjoy eating them and i think these would make a great snack while watching a movie on tv perhaps eventually he will move back to commercial location and serve the empanadas as a lunch time will tell until then these are very well priced and good for a lunch or a snack", "small place with straightforward menu food is great for value tried the chicken and beef empanadas loved them both they have the frozen option as well that seemed to be a popular pick for a lot of people coming in", "my empandas is a little hole in the wall kind of place on ave and street outside not much to see inside well its pretty small and it looks like they are doing some renovations but if you want empandas this is the place to go to they have a variety of meat empandas like cajun pulled pork and philly cheese steak as well as a few vegetarian choices yes empanadas as fusion food like piza which they also have but it works the price is right too got me empanadas that were delicious and pretty filling you can buy them frozen and cook yourself at home or get them to cook them in the store i got them to cook them in the store and it seems like they bake them which is fine by me it does take a few minutes maybe or but while you wait there are a few free tables and wifi the owner was friendly and happy to talk and genuinely wanted to know how i found out about my empanadas through yelp of course i got of the cajun empanadas and they were good not very spicy but i wish i would have tried another kind as well lucky for me it looks like i will need to go back and try some of their other flavors", "delivery charge and then to use the interact machine is brutal never order from here", "craving late night munchies this place has good food and late hours crazy late hours like in the morning late hours they offer a solid donair for that time of night balanced flavours generous toppings and good sauce but its was not special enough to have me drive all the way over here past my regular donair shops while their still open but at am nobody does it better", "i like giving different places that offer donairs a shot each place is so person specific you either love it or hate it this place was not in my hate column the service was prompt and polite lots of parking in this new building area and sufficient tables inside the donair i ordered was a regular size and meaty the meat was flavourful but my only complaint is the lack of sauce in my donair i was not a mess when i was done eating it but i will be back", "first review but this man deserves it what a welcoming establishment great menu very very friendly staff thanks guys", "disappointing super sweet sauce stale pita no masked staff kitchen cookowner and worker or relative that used the closed bathroom both without were masks or food prep gloves major health hazard this is why you choose to pay on pick up whenever you can figured i would try a local donair shop using a skip gc unfortunately it was abysmal despite skip rating the pita was dry tough like it sat too long similar to stale bread additionally it was not warmed or steamed to my knowledge as the donair was cool on pick up right before the estimated ready time the donair meat was dry sweet sauce is hfcs sweet overpowering i like a thicker sauce that binds better to the meat veggies but this is way too sweet richards donair across street by dollarama lazia by rd ave leagues better primetime downtown worth the drive i am going to as it consistently good quality will not be back due to lack of sanitation food quality", "went to this donair shop thinking i would have a delicious donair was i ever wrong awful meat soggy pita vegetables that looked like they fell on the floor cheese tasted like plastic as someone whose eaten at over donair shops in alberta this was hands down the worst fast forward months and i am willing to give them another shot as bad experiences are sometimes not the norm anyway i order through skip the dishes and minutes later driver calls and tells me owner gave him bucks to not deliver order because its late and they are cleaning up kitchen and order was processed but unfortunately my food will not be delivered people take your money and run swiss donair is the best alternative", "this is the place yes the donair place that you have been looking for the gravy on the poutine tastes like the old kfc gravy before kfc changed the recipe and ruined it the donair meat has the perfect kick of spice to it and the service was outstanding the gentleman who served me was patient and kind and since i told him it was my first time there he was sure to explain everything to me including all my sauce and topping choices its suprisingly very modern and clean inside this definitely is not your standard donair shop awesome", "love this place have not done a thing wrong better than swiss donair i come almost everyday", "north edmonton relatively unexplored territory yet for over the twenty plus years of residence it was reigned by swiss donair when it comes to shawarma an arabic meat preparation of various meats kept on a vertical rotating spit and carved to serve then up came eddies donair a few years ago and all of a sudden the reign was at question uprising revolt whatever you can call it the public i am talking about my friends here argued who was the supreme donair king for years swiss donair has been the hangout of choice fond memories of junior and high school times late night eats an oilers hockey game here and there swiss donair in my mind has always been the best donair of the city much less north edmonton with more and more of my friends now suggesting eddies donair as the new it place i just had to do a side by side comparison bring in the experts meet josh human garburator i have known josh since junior high and he has been my personal garburator for some time eating my leftovers throughout university and thus allowing me to order whatever and however much i want a former swiss fan he is probably responsible for all of my friends converting to eddies slight bias to eddies noted meet petey my reviews biggest fan that is self explanatory but peteys love for food has no boundaries enjoys swiss prefers homestyle south edmonton and has never tried eddies and sharon non biased donair judge you have met her before a harsher critic than i am has tried both swiss and eddies but has no favorite i assembled the four of us together at my house for a eddies donair vs swiss donair throwdown last week and here is what happened both are easy to find in north edmonton although eddies donair is a little bit more residential plenty of parking there whereas swiss is harder pressed i went to go order and pick up at eddies for the night there was only one guy behind the counter and only one person in front of me ordering to go nobody dining in josh was responsible for the swiss pick up who on the other hand was packed tons of people ordering and half the seats full swiss wins hands down for atmosphere for that night we arrived simultaneously at my house perfect timing two regular cheese donairs and large fries from eddies two regular cheese donairs and small fries from swiss between the four of us we each got half a donair here is the side by side eddies pros thicker cuts of meat more meat ratio than vegetables this could be positive or negative depending and a thicker pita bread thank you petey for observing that the sauce was sweeter compared to swiss and a pepper y aftertaste eddies cons i would have liked more sauce swiss pros meat was moist and tender with a crispier edge suggesting that they reheated it in the pan for a good amount of time before wrapping swiss cons not sure if maybe there was more sauce or not but the thinner pita bread made it harder to eat nobody likes a mess verdict a unanimous vote for eddies donair as the winner who would have thought both were very close but when eaten side by side we all had a preference sharon was the first to conclude she liked eddies better according to josh swiss donair has declined in quality and its glory days are over perhaps so josh petey and myself agreed that swiss meat was better prepared and yet we all came back to eddies to finish off other considerations the fries from eddies were deliciously deep fried and out shined swiss fries although those had seasoning salt both portion of fries were the same size eddies being the more expensive both donairs cost the same each although eddies had more meat if that is your thing we all agreed that both were good enough that whatever was closest or on the way would be the donair of choice if the four of us were on council though eddies donair is the new reigning king of north edmonton what do you think", "eddies serves a tasty chicken donair with fantastic garlic sauce and like my other favourite donair places they grilled some onions for me and placed them on service is friendly and welcoming unlike another nearby donair institution the pizza is actually quite tasty and inexpensive as well and unlike most donair shops eddies is quite comfortable to sit in they have padded booths and lighting that is not fluorescent check it out if you are in the area", "i really like this donair shop in north edmonton the meat is tasty not burned or dried some places like to saute the donair meat for too long in an overused underwashed pan before wrapping it up they advertise that they use local meat i did not look into this further but that is a definitive plus for me normally i do not care for sweet sauce but i gave this one a try it was really good not too sweet and really peppery almost too spicy for this lightweight my only minor quibble is that i asked for grilled onions on my donair the guy said that would be cool and then i bit into crunchy raw onions later on i have an intolerance to raw onions but cooked ones do not make me sick i should have made this clear to the clerk before handing over my cash", "such friendly staff and awesome donairs the poutine was a bit too peppery for my liking but great serving size my husband got the onion rings and they were perfect", "super delicious amazing service and comfortable interior i have been recently craving donairs and was looking for a place to take my family for dinner then i stumbled upon eddies donair this was definitely a choice i did not regret and i definitely see myself going here more often because their donairs are delicious and i want to fill up that stamp card i ordered eddies cheese donair although i was warned by the cashier that it was spicy but me being me i was like i can handle it i could not handle it but i enjoyed every bite of it despite my low tolerance for spice the donair meat was delicious and the banana peppers and hot sauce added the perfect kick i also ordered a large fries to share with my mom but we ended up sharing it with the whole family because it was in fact large and took up most of the tray the fries were crispy and fresh and were seasoned perfectly", "they serve fantastic pizzas for a really good price the only thing that would make this place better is if they had a strictly pepperoni pizza", "this is both a lunch and dinner type of place the first time i went there the were so nice and the servise is awesome out of would recomend", "well i got bad cramps and threw up health department said pitas to be cooked twice see them cut it off roll and watch them cook it noticed under new management same problems as before maybe a new kitchen will clean it up", "out of most donair places that i have tried this place out done itself by far the sweet sauce is fantastic and the donair meat does not taste like its been dried the fries are also flour coated cooked into the deep fryer which gives it this nice crisp crunch taste complimented with their soda bottle barbican it makes a complete manly combo by which you will be full and feel like you spent your moneys worth staff is friendly parking is moderately big dining is space is big and well lit they have tvs to watch sports or anything else sometimes they play rap music quite a lot at this location i would not mind a variety of music just my opinion i will definitely be back here when i am craving a delightful taste of donairs they also skip the dishes which is good if your lazy or not able to drive here also if you come here often make sure you grab a collecting card for every donairs you buy the th one is free strongly recommended for any donair taster like myself prepare your tastebuds for a sweet addicting taste", "this place is disgusting who puts bbq sauce on a donair do yourself a favour and never ever order food from this place also who argues with the customer when you point out your order was wrong", "we went here as a fluke the two other places i wanted to go to were closed pretty basic pizza and donair menu i would have liked it if they had falafels too not too many veg options unless you want pizza service was professional and quick i picked a super chicken donair and my husband got the donair combo i really liked how full they filled their donairs with veggies and meat meat was tasty in both donairsi really liked the garlic sauce my husband enjoyed his donair too however he did not like the fries and after sampling them i could see whytoo much sugar in the seasoning not much to say about the atmospheretypical fast food looking place not comfortable to sit and stay i think if you are a donair person you should really check this joint out pizza prices seemed reasonable so maybe i will come back to check that out since all thier veggies and meat seem fresh", "ah eddies i moved to the northside during covid and eddies has become both a go to and a godsend i love donairs so my bar is pretty high and eddies not only reached it but surpassed it while the place itself is no frills its a donair shop were not expecting five star dining right the food is amazing the staff are super friendly and now remember my order as i walk in the door and the quality is consistent every time portion sizes are great as well so you will never leave hungry maybe i am biased but eddies will always have a special place in my heart my fiance happened to adopt our cat after finding him outside the shop the cat has great taste and its the last meal i ate right before i got engaged my fiance and i could not be happier to be regulars and to support a local business that crushes it with flavour and quality", "eddies is my favourite place for their donors and they actually make very good pizzas so you can not go wrong with them and their prices are extremely fair for four people off i paid about and they offered off for a pick up order", "i really really like this place there are always people coming in it is a bit of a distance from home so i always stay it is comfortable and clean they are always super friendly the service is quick as well they have tables and little booths the ketchup and mayo are in the fridge for those staying the regular donair is the right size we purchased a kids donair as well which is perfect i like that the kids have the option of the tomato lettuce and onion other places it is lettuce only as the default the donair meat has a fantastic flavour i really liked the fries they are very crisp and seasoned they also have a card if you buy donairs you get one regular donair plus a can of pop", "love this place have not done a thing wrong better than swiss donair i come almost everyday", "increadible donair in my continuing mission to sample every donair shop e town has to offer eddies was a great find i would rank this anong my top as i approached the end of my super cheese donairi must confess i considered ordering a second it was really good the best place i have tried to date in the northside for my super with cheese and a bottle of ho puts it on par with the competion but the flavourfull meat and delicious sweet sauce whitlch really stood outthough i can not put my finger on why very clean modern shop with a great feel friendly helpfull staff i was only a little dissapointed that the only other patron was clearly a friend of theirs and i overheard a few f bombs exchanged at the counter not very professional i certainly hope that had their audience been differenttheir language would have been as wellbut one never knows as my kids were at homei only cared because againits just not professional anywaysfour letter words asside what a great donair rather than daring to day best in town i now pose to myself the question would i be happy if this were my local donair shop and to answermyself i wound not only be happyi would be thrilledand likely lbs heavier", "if you are the type of person that orders a salad at a donair shop or has ever complained about having too much meat on one then read no further go eat at a pita pit eddies donairs are the best i have found in edmonton so far make sure you try eddies specialty donair as it is unique spicy and delicious the service here is very friendly and eddie is a stand up guy the place has always been clean donairs are prepared safely and i have never had a negative experience", "fresh ingredients friendly staff clean shop and decent prices this place has a local small business feel customers that come in strike up conversations and say goodbye when they leave staff are engaged in their interactions and appear genuine store seats about at tables and booths two big screen tvs play sports and music good quality comfort food in a friendly atmosphere this place is special", "we stumbled onto this place because we could not find anything open i did not have much expectations and this was before covid restrictions were more laxed so we had to eat them in our van in the rain really the atmosphere was a pretty generic eat and go fast food place nothing special to report menu is pretty standard they do beef and chicken donairs i like a good falafel but they do not have them i ordered a super chicken donair with garlic sauce and my husband did the a donair combo with garlic sauce with a pop i did like how you could choose between three sauces sweet garlic and taziki staff were friendly food was good all the veggies were fresh and we both enjoyed the spiced meat and they stuffed it however both of us did not enjoy the fries the fries had an odd taste with their seasoning too sweet however if we were in the area we would definately eat there again minus the fries", "well i ordered from there on uber eats and my understanding of the way the menu readscombo regular cheese donair for that only included a can of pop and fries then anything you pick its this that tax delivery extra charge for what ever plus tipits then they forgot the banna peppers i totally thought it was a great deal if it was donairs needles to say next time just order from the store skip delivery and save money", "eddies is the best donair place in edmonton in my humble opinion big portions funny staff and most importantly amazing food they have the classics your good old regular beef donair with sweet sauce as well as some of their own creations like eddies spicy with cheese as well as a philly cheesesteak flavour i highly recommend getting their housemade hot sauce on your donair its spicy but not too spicy just enough to give a bit of a tang i love the way eddies makes their donairs they put the pita on the fryer as well as the meat so that way its cooked to perfection and everything is at the perfect temperature so warm and very melt in your mouth i have yet to try their pizza but i have heard good things that is definitely next on my list", "increadible donair in my continuing mission to sample every donair shop e town has to offer eddies was a great find i would rank this among my top as

reliable been ordering from here for years great pizza and value for the money awesome spring rolls tip get donair sauce for dipping", "hollywood pizza is located in the strathearn neighbourhood and has been there for many years one of the very few pizza places that has stood the test of time its run by a friendly husband and wife team and has remained consistent in quality fair prices and fast friendly service and delivery the pizza food are always piping hot having that fresh from the oven taste the pizza crust and pizza sauce are always delicious and if your are a fan of spring rolls be sure to order some by far the very best i have ever had in edmonton", "the donair was better than i expected based on walking in this is not a donair joint no matter what the name implies the meat was precut and stored which is disappointing however it was inexpensive and quite large the pita was soft and the sauce was ok served on the side probably will not be back but if this was my neighbourhood i probably still would not be back", "so never had a problem with my order being wrong when i used the app on my phone to order but one i decided to call in my order and this is when my order was taken wrong when my order arrived i was missing part of my order i stopped the driver and asked where the rest of my order was the manager apologized and gave me a credit of an amount larger then what was missing in my order which i thought was great the next time i ordered the credit was not applied to my ordermaybe because i used the app again instead of calling in so the next time we had a pizza fix i called in and asked about my credit it was still there and they said yes i was also told since i had a credit i did not get the items i wanted on the special price i would have to pay the regular price so really the credit was really nothing special as the large pizza on special and regular price was close to i guess do not call in and order using the app is the way to go or even better order from somewhere else if they are going to punish you for their mistakes", "i have been attending the university for years now and i just recently learnt about this place last semester i absolutely love this place the individual size pizza is filling with the thick and crispy crust i have only tried the bulgogi pizza and it is always tasty and made fresh it is now my go to for a quick bite whenever i need to grab lunch", "it has been at least years since i have stepped foot in academy pizza my wife and i were in campus for alumni weekend and took a walk through hub mall for a little trip down memory lane i was ecstatic when i saw that academy was still there we ran inside and saw that the menu has pretty much stayed the same along with the menu the ambience has not changed either it looks just the same even when i was at the you it looked a little old the great thing is that it has not aged i told the lady that it had been years since ordering as my wife and i both ordered the lasagna she was surprised and very sweet she hoped we would enjoy it again after that long we took a seat and i reminisced about some of the busy lunches i spent there once we got the lasagna we both dug in and from the first bite it was the same delicious taste as it had always been smothered in cheese this is the way lasagna is done and is easily one of the best in the city as my wife stated since she is a lasagna connoisseur thank you academy pizza for staying as amazing and personable as always service with kindness and a smile", "there is nothing like a pizza when you are in the midst of university and need to stress eat away the pain of millions of assignments midterms failed group projects while the university experience may be lacking in many respects academy pizza is not its a lovely little place to come and get some italian style food pizzas pastas soups and more the staff who work there are the biggest sweethearts and i love hearing the lady calling out peoples numbers with her adorable accent it just brings a smile to my face every time i am there the personal pizzas are just the right size and give you quite the bang for your buck especially when compared to what the pizza on campus gives you they have got a thicker crust to keep you full with plenty of cheese and toppings the sauce is a little on the tangy side of the spectrum but its nothing too extreme you can also get the personal pizza combod with other menu items if you are feeling particularly peckish the pasta portions are huge luckily they come in little tinfoil containers so you can pack up any leftovers you have without any hassle they also come with a free side of garlic bread which is awesome who does not like garlic bread academy pizza is definitely one of the better places to stop for a meal on campus reasonably priced and filling the main criteria for every uni student", "the personal pans here are so good pepperoni with banana peppers always hits the spot it costs around dollars for a personal pan pizza and it usually fills you up they also have good lasagna which is about but you get a lot for that price it is located inside hub mall and it is set up like a mini restaurant it has a seating area inside and then a patio area which is still inside but you can see people walking in hub which is pretty cool be careful eating here before you have to study because its so greasy and filling that you will be ready to pass out right after", "i have to admit i recently had one of my worst dining experiences ever at this very boston pizza i went on a very slow saturday night only about of the lounge was full and both myself and my girlfriend ordered a rickards white pint about halfway through my pint as she started on hers she noticed that the orange slice that comes with the beer was speckled with dark blue mold delicious we pointed this out to the staff and encouraged them to look at all their oranges for this issue she came back with a new pint for my girlfriend and stated that all the oranges were bad this obviously must have included the two beers we had already drank there was no apology no compensation for such an issue you would have thought that we would have at least received an apology for serving us rotten fruit with our drinks needless to say i will not be going to this boston pizza nor any other ones in the future", "have not been in a boston pizza for a while but came here for lunch we sat in the lounge since it was pretty busy this day i had the boston brute sub to shake things up i had rice and couscous on the side it was all good and as expected no one had any real complaints boston pizza is always a reliable run of the mill place the can make you an acceptable lunch", "terrible boston pizza terwillegar is not able to get orders straight has messed up the caesar salad addition to an entree not once but three times first two times the salad was missing and the third time after i complained and said i could not eat bacon this is what i received double the bacon in the salad and a lump of bacon crouton dumped into the caesar salad dressing userswendytaylordesktopbp imgjpguserswendytaylordesktopbp imgjpg", "i ordered take out the chicken mushroom linguine took a bite of a mushroom and got a mouth full of what i think was dirt messaged the store and got a very uncaring response they sent me a credit to cover my initial cost but that was it no apology and only good for a month mistakes happen its how you deal with it that counts this feels like a fail to me", "t was very unfortunate that we went to boston pizza calgary trail location at and found out that the door were locked for the customer i believe that boston pizzas serve till am and the last calls for food is at am upon shaking the doors we saw a person inside in the dark as the lights were off but the person did not bother to come and tell us if they were closed for the day or even open for take out your restaurant timing are mentioned at the entrance but no were it say or even we decided to walk away as there was no point arguing with the staff as we know what kind of service we will get after that so i decided to order a take out at pizza and not to go for boston pizzas anymore specially that store as this was the second time we had a bad experience at the same store but as my wife likes pizzas at boston pizza she called one of the other location in south side on ave nw the server madison who answered the phone took our order and was more than willing to accommodate us to eat in the restaurant while they were closing which me and my wife were very thankful to her we were delighted when she came over and offered us non alcoholic beverages she was just great i think you should change the operational hours for calgary trail location which will help you to avoid customer dissatisfaction and hire more customer and service oriented staff me and my wife we both come from a service background infact we work in the hospitality industry so we know a feedback like this might not make that much of a difference to the business but it does gives a message to the customers that we do not need your business", "hi i like bps but i just want to say do not order the steak sandwich it was just a pile of fat and gristle in a bun with onions i kept pulling the car and it would not stop coming thought i found a decent bite but could not get my teeth through it just gristle and more fat beef dip is good though", "exactly what you would expect i do not usually go to chain restaurants especially like boston pizza this location is quite close to the whitemud highway as a vegan boston pizza does not have many options i had to make my own pasta order which was decent in general the lack of options for me and the refusal of boston pizza to modernize their menu makes their rating go down", "i have to say that i am a boston pizza connoisseur call it tacky or whatever i love bps i do not get the opportunity to go to this bps very often but when i do it is on sunday evenings its pretty much completely dead and its basically like sitting out on your own patio with waiter service the patio is nice and warm and the food is that homey bps food that we all love this location is definitely one of my favourites i have been feeling lost since i had to change bps locations from the west side its nice to switch it up if you can not tell i love bps haha", "what can i say other then this place has great pizza its my neighborhood steak and pizza joint and has been a family favorite probably for years yes the pizzas are smaller compared to other pizza places and yes they are a much higher cost of other pizza places but its family run homemade with great ingredients you will not regret the extra cost another favorite dish is the t bone steak dinner with baked potato wonderful", "we came here recently for dinner and it was a nice homey place we shared a large pizza and added pineapple as an extra topping which was wonderful we were impressed by how much pineapple they added to our pizza which made me really pleased as a patron this location has high chairs available and the restrooms are small but functional staff were really helpful also well definitely be back at some point when we want such deep pizza with lots of toppings and will keep this place in mind for takeoutdelivery as well i am also curious about the rest of the menu", "i first had this pizza when i was growing up in edmonton an aunt of mine lives a block from here and the last time i would have had it would have been in my late teens before i left edmonton after a year absence i moved back here in and was surprised to see that this place was still around given the often high turn over rate in restaurants it had been on the must try list for a while and i finally went there this week went with a friend and we ordered a pizza since that was the whole point of the visit i was not sure whether the two of us should order a large or an extra large but hey its pizza and leftovers just means that you have something for breakfast or lunch the next day without cooking we ended up ordering an extra large all meat pizza the pizza was good this is not your purist naples style traditional pizza but a more traditional canadian style pizza with a thicker doughy yet light crust meat toppings were generous as well as the cheese pizza was not cut into the standard triangular shaped wedges but into squares which my dining companion likes because for whatever reason he enjoys the corner parts which are mostly crust only down side is their sauce which needs a bit of something to give it some zip but that is a pretty minor complaint did not detract from the overall pizza just not quite spicy enough for my tastes overall a good pizza that was worth the trip and obviously the reason why they are still around after years", "i went back to dallas pizza steak house yesterday and this time i opted for takeout pizza got to say probably one of the best pizzas i have had in a long time they have a few signature pizzas and build your own obvz but i went for the greek pizza olives onions fresh tomatoes green peppers and feta cheese i placed the order then went back mins later to collect it the lady who served me was lovely she was super friendly and even gave my daughter a lollipop and a colouring sheet to take home i told her i recently moved nearby and she gave me a menu to keep i had no idea they also do deliveries great to know looking at the menu its a lot more than just pizza and steak there is salads pastas donairs and burgers i have not veered from steak and pizza as of yet but happy to know i can get a steak dinner delivered to my door back to my pizza i got a large for three of us to share and it was enormous it is more like a deep dish pizza all those toppings stashed under the delicious cheese you can not pick any toppings off which could be an issue for kids or picky eaters because the toppings were hidden my daughter ate it all including the olives even the base sauce was rich and flavourful i can not fault it ill definitely be choosing dallas over any other pizza place around in fact i am eating the leftovers for breakfast right now and its still good", "best pizza in edmonton cheesy great toppings sweet dough better than royal not good if you like cardboard with no cheese like the fast food types", "real greek own the place so the pizza is just awsome if not the best in the citythe restaurant is very nice and clean and always busyme and my daughter were pretty disapointed with the chicken slouvakiit was just basic grilled piecesnot much taste and the greek salad was like a few days oldthe lasagna was great and they give you a very generous portion", "i would put dallas pizza and steakhouse firmly in the hidden gem category its a little off the beaten track but more than makes up for it with the food i have been there a couple of times now the first time was a lunch time visit where i had a pizza delicious i had the bbq chicken the second visit was for dinner a bit of an on a whim visit whilst driving past i ordered the new york steak this came exactly as ordered medium rare the baked potato on the side was cooked just the way i like it the salad was fresh and crunchy so in short pizza good steak great price is decent if you are after fancy decor this is not the place for you but like i said earlier the food more than makes up for it keep up the good work guys", "been meaning to try this place for a while its a cute little independent restaurant that smells like pizza as soon as you open the door the style has a very old school albertan vibe to it it was quiet which was perfect for me and my husband as we had just left the ski club and wanted somewhere to chill i heard the pizza was great but i eat a lot of pizza so opted for the steak instead i asked for medium but should have went for the medium rare as the meat was only a touch pink my fault i ordered it with a baked potato which came with its own lazy susan of toppings that was a nice touch the service was good and that garlic bread it did not look like much but it was really very tasty indeed the garnish on the plate was a little odd with an orange slice thrown in there but i was so hungry i ate everything on my plate orange n all the prices were reasonable and the food was good its not super fancy but it does the job", "really fabulous pizza the other meals are ok but nothing special a bit on the bland side that being said i came here for the pizza and was surprised in fact i burnt my mouth many times because combine hunger and tasty pizza and it was gone definitely recommend try the pizza if your in the area cheers", "maybe it was me this review may be biasedas i left before eating i arrived at dallas with my kids looking forward to something new upon entering i was pleasantly surprised by how busy albeit small the place was which indicated they have a following after standing inside thd door for a few moments we were greeted by a slightly surprised looking woman upon concluding it was just the three of usshe invited us to take a seat and so it began now i admit i heard her follow this invitation up with at any table for alasmy year old and year old did not and while i went to get my own booster seat which the waitress pointed at when i asked if they had any my kids settled in to the only booth i saw which happened to bei believea table for as i brought my own booster to the table my kids had chosen the last thing i was worried about was theserverstable for comment i was in a rush and eager to order as my kids settled in one server came over and remarked on the need to change seats i kind of ignored her to be honest as my daughter began to hand out our cutlery she wandered away mumbling another woman approached us and told me point blank that we would have to move as this was their only large table i had had enough i remarked that we would be happy to move right out the door the response from the employee was something to the effect of a snide have a nice night just not impressed perhaps the food is good but in my opinion if you can not be bothered to show me to my seat or grab me a booster when i request one then you can live with me sitting where my children choose if you want to do your job as a serverand seat me andwellwait on methen i am all yours and so is my money too bad i had such high hopes", "big hearty greasy excellent pizza we live a block away and will often walk over for pickup when entertaining a group of suddenly hungry artists can not comment on any other menu items as we never have ordered them their pizza is what makes them famous", "i rarely post a review anywhere but i can tell you dallas pizza makes the best pizza in the cityperiod my grumpy old dad refused to eat pizza and hated when us kids ate pizza because apparently he thinks its garbage food in his opinion but after giving him no other food option presented him with an extra large ham pineapple from dallas what happened boy did his tune change and for years now when he comes to visit he only wants pizza from dallas if we ordered pizza recently my second favorite entree is their baked spaghettimmmmm i even day dream about it its so yummy and comforting eat in take out or deliver y we just love dallas pizza", "great quality pizza for a reasonable price the pizza has lots of cheese and thick crust typical grandma style", "i grew up in edmonton and my family knows the owners here they are the nicest people you could hope to meet after my parents moved away i continued to order or stop by from time to time i have to say that if you want absolutely fantastic food to order or go out to a decent price and great atmosphere this is the place you want to be heading to walking into this restaurant is like walking into a french bakery first thing in the morning the aroma of delicious food hits you in the face harder than a very angry mike tyson after his divorce the atmosphere makes you feel like your in your own home the service is excellent with very pleasant and courteous staff and you will never walk away hungry the best here is the lasagna you can dine in take out or have it delivered", "excellent place to eat very friendly staff and very delicious food i highly recommend this place and i also have a feeling this restaurant will do very will", "i have been to different blaze pizzas in edmonton and area and all were exactly the same you choose your crust i choose thin they make it in front of you then you can choose from or sauces or cheeses or meats and a huge assortment of veggies i always get red sauce ricotta cheese artichoke hearts mushrooms and i always have leftovers its nice that they make it in front of you the wood fire oven is even in front of you when your pizza is done you can choose from finishes chipotle ranch arugula etc they have agua fresca in juice fountains and those are refillable its pretty loud in there and i took my mom once and she was very overwhelmed by the menu and the process it was not fun so maybe keep seniors at home for pizza just a tip she is not even that old i am talking early s not s but i promise you will be hooked on this pizza i never would have imagined putting ricotta on a pizza but its the best thing ever see you there", "blaze pizza sherwood park generally my go to place as well as my family and every time i go i get pizzas so it is not cheap at all maybe the worst service i have gotten from blaze pizza the staff are not friendly and they all seem as if they hate there job the staff at the downtown location in edmonton are always happy and outgoing but i live in sherwood park so it make more sense to go to the one that is local to sherwood park but after tonight i will not be back in a awhile pizza was a bit burnt as well they might have been new but they need to be trained its customer based and people are spending a lot on pizza", "updating review based on last experience at the emerald hills blaze pizza much like my first visit the pizza was great blaze pizza is essentially a pizzeria version of sub restaurants as it offers a lot of customization options with addition to several great pizza types you can add or remove any other toppings you like as well as choose from multiple dough options to create your perfect pizza overall the food is great but the service was not entirely professional the first employee i interacted with walked us through the customization process and after explaining that we could choose two pizza types and split the pizza she pointed to my face and said but you do not seem like the type who would want to share and made the same remark after asking if i would like a salad when going for lunch i should not have to worry about my self esteem dropping even further when i am just in search of a good meal very unprofessional rating updated", "i took my wife and toddlers here for pizza night they were very accommodating regarding dietary restrictions they allowed us to split a pizza for the girls with different toppings marked the sides and cut the pieces extra thin they gave us extra water glasses and were just so helpful it made our evening so much easier the food was great and the price was reasonable well be going back in the future", "buyer beware its only been in the area less than a year and the pizza itself has always been great however today during a pickup for my online order the cashier attempted to quickly add just before i was to tap my debit card i caught the number just as it was going through so i asked for a receipt the register was showing the extra dollars then what i remember the online order coming too the cashier adjusted the order back the dollars and issued my receipt hoping i would not catch the change i quickly opened my bank app and verified the additional had been charged to my account i spoke with the manager and it was quickly resolved however if i had not been vigilant i would of never caught it", "lots of pizza joints in the riverbend area but this place tastes way better than the rest but not sure about the garlic dipping sauce go with the blue cheese overall you will be happy with food and service", "have to give a yelp out to papa john for their great dollar deal on mondays for their topping pizza unfortunately i can not give a higher grade then for todays experience papa john has a lot going for it compared to the other chain pizza guys and i hope my future visits will result in a better experience for me today i ordered pizzas and got charged a bit over dollars which of course was a couple bucks too much i am not normally a complaining type and was in a hurry so i did not really care alot but it hurts the score here i found out when i got the pizzas home that the reason i got charged was they had put toppings on one of the pizzas and charged me for it i am not sure what the second topping was maybe anchovies accidents will happen but they do effect ratings also the pizza was a bit too dry for my taste i can fix that by ordering extra sause next time i am sure taste wise this is not world class pizza but then again for bucks you can not expect world class pizza there are other deals at papa johns too and if you take advantage of them then i feel this is about the best value going in the discount pizza marketplace you do get a free dipping sause and a free pepperconi pepper with every pizza too can not ever argue against free giveaways all in all i hope this review comes off as a thumbs up the pizza was filling as all pizzas are it definitely was better tasting then the frozen stuff you pick up at the supermarket and actually cheaper then alot of those frozen choices too", "enjoyable pizza and a good price not special but not bad if you are thinking of pizza this is a better choice", "wonderful great location helpful staff and great prices the boyfriend will ordering from here all the time", "great deals fast and fresh always order online to get points for a free pizza dips are good", "this was my first time ever ordering from papa johns i had a serious craving for some pizza and was recommended this place i tried to use their online ordering option and was very disappointed it was difficult to navigate so i decided to just call which was just as painful the service was thorough and friendly but a lot of questions and repeating everything i had already agreed to maybe i am being a little dramatic but it was a pain and i just wanted an ordinary pepperoni pizza and believe it should take mins on the phone to do so whether its talking to someone or just pressing a few options in an app so the lovely lady on the phone said it would be ready for pick up at my selected location in apx mins being a punctual person i was there right on time sadly my pizza was not quite ready happily i only waited about mins my pizza was as ordered but i was expecting bacon slices like pictured on the website not crumbled bacon bits but it was still a relatively good pizza not the best i have had in the city but worth the price i suggest taking advantage of their check in deal and on mondays they offer a medium one topping pizza for a great deal i will likely try pjs again but probably only on mondays", "tried the new pizza place and was disappointed first they mixed up the large and medium order then they gave us under cooked pizza poor customer service after that would not recommend first and last visit for us", "worse than the last time cashier needed to hear the order times and still got it wrong i do not know about the other food here but the donairs are unbelievably overpriced and definitely not worth it sweet sauce is unlike any i have ever seen and its not a good change like another review said we got a regular and a jumbo and literally had to compare the ingredients to distinguish them because they were the same size for an extra dollars", "ordered food and they prepared it with bare hands answered the phone and then wrote with a pen and paper and then continued preparing my food with there bare hands it is extremely unsanitary and against the rules will never eat here again i threw my food away", "went in for a jumbo donair cost was nice lady at the till asked if i wanted cheese and that brought it up to over most donair places include cheese for a jumbo but whatever place looked very clean and professional so i gave it a shot donair was handed to me by the creepy i assume manager who leers at his employees and is obviously making them uncomfortable got home and the donair is hardly the size of a regular at most places meat was good and mildly spicy but the sweet sauce was very thin and had little flavour literally just ran down and pooled at the bottom of the bag before i even got halfway through the donair can anyone tell me where in edmonton you can eat an entire jumbo donair and still be hungry usually i can not finish them definetly not worth dollars i do not know about the rest of their food but i will not be coming back three stars for the floors countertops and workstations all absoloutely spotless but the donair deserves two stars", "i ordered the beef donair and i have to say it was the most disappointing one i have ever had the beef was cut in chunks rather than slices the onions were cut in large chunks which overpowered the flavor of the rest the tomatoes were few the extra cheese i added could not be tasted and the sweet sauce so runny it was in the bottom of the bag it was also cold when received i also ordered the ground beef and bacon pizza it was so greasy and i believe made with a barbecue sauce which did not go well the entire pizza went to waste as we could not eat it please take my word and order from pizza city donair around the corner from best bite they know how to make a delicious and extremely huge donair so much for trying someplace new", "the food was amazing we got pizza a jumbo donair that fed people and a poutine i will be ordering again for sure they are an amazing addition to the community yummy", "the food is amazing if you use a coupon or ask for extra sauce on a donair they charge an extra you have to request a receipt and in my case they were unable to give me one because of a computer glitch donairs cost with cheese and sauce which is not according to the menu prices no fries or drinks and it was almost per small size donair if you are willing to pay more the food is really good though", "i love this place the food quality is good the ownersstaff are incredibly friendly and the restaurant is clean its quick and the staff remember you even if you have only been here a couple times it impresses me that every time you walk in there is a smile on their faces and they are happy to serve you as so many places now lack good customer service this place exceeded my expectations enough to write my first review glad its in the neighborhood and myself and my husband will be back", "a new to windermere burger place but has other stuff on the menu including pizza donair chicken wings and milkshakes the food is very tasty and reasonably priced you get a good portion on your side orders of fries or onion rings and they are very tasty milkshake is very thick and high quality i would rate this place as far as taste goes better then five guys also the place is very clean which is a bonus", "best pizza ever and a family ran business love it here i always get amazing service the three cheese pizza is so good i have not tried much else but if anything is like the pizza its worth the try", "ordered reg donair jumbo donair onion rings and piece nuggets and tater tots for the kids the donair meat was really flavorful and was actually really good could not really distinguish between reg and jumbo found the portions extreme small especially the onion ringsliterally got skinny onions rings with the order and very similar with tater tots total for donairs piece nuggets w tater tots and onion rings came to tip let us just say i left hungrytasty foodbut cost vs portion size seems like it needs adjusting", "i ordered best bite the other day i got a beef donair mozza sticks which comes with a garlic sauce and a rootbeer milkshake and i was pleasantly surprised all of my food was fresh and tasted delicious i will order from them again i have no complaints", "the food is very good but the service unfortunately is terrible the manager or owner or franchisee goes out of his way to overcharge you and not use coupons and the staff are very unfriendly as well it cost me three dollars to have garlic sauce put on my donair and it was about tablespoon also napkins cost extra", "the pizza here is by far the best i have ever had an the owners are awesome they got a client for life", "if you are looking for that classic pizza wings place this is the place priced well great selection burgers and donairs are great as well never tried anything on the menu i have not liked owner and his family are super nice people", "officially is behind me and its pretty good i was in the windermere area so naturallyi had to scratch another off my ever expanding list st impression shiney bright new prices look on par no issue with employee i order my obligatory large donair with sweet sauce and side garlic sauce and a bottle of water on par at for everything value is decent could have used a little more meat as i had the middle of their three sizes i really enjoyed the thick cut meat which was pretty well seasoned veggies were fresh and colorful sweet sauce was a little on the runny side but i could certainly taste it throughout garlic sauce was also decent pita was fresh and held up all things being equalim satisfied not the bestbut no obviouse issurs either perhaps a little more volume for my dollar i could certainly handle these folks as my local shop", "this is a superb restaurant we went on a wednesday night at about pm and the place was buzzingvery busy we are lucky we got a table we ordered a salad and it was extraordinary very fresh tasty dressing and the portion was huge we followed that with the house lasagna and it was delicious too we then ordered a pizza and it was up there with the best we have ever had it was cooked perfect the crust was crispy but on the thick side the sauce was soooo goodand the toppings and cheese were perfect they definitely know pizza capital has an awesome menu and we are going to go back to try the steaks and some more appetizers service was excellent and friendly it was cool seeing what we think was the owner greet people this fella knows his hospitality there was a woman who came in for a takeout pizza and it was not quite ready and he offered her a complimentary soda or coffee while she waited not a big deal but the gesture was pure gold can not wait to go back and i look forward to trying the t bone steaknot many places have the nards to offer one of them", "i got wings from here yesterday and they were disgraceful not only were they outrageously price but they were not even sauced there was barely any in the package", "just went for their breakfastbrunch menu western skillet and pancakes can not be beat for taste and price will definitely be coming again for breakfast and trying their other menu options", "my family and i made a reservation for christmas eve it was a person reservation a reservation that large can normally because a problem for most restaurants not at capital pizza the service was speedy and professional and the food was excellent the owner even introduced himself and made sure everything was running smoothly i had the seafood lasagna and it was amazing my uncle sylvano a dyed in the wool italian man even complimented the chef on his excellent food my family and i agree that we will be returning for christmas next year cheers", "i used to be a regular in the s when there was only one capital pizzas were awesome loaded with toppings and cheese cheeseburgers were made with real ground beef the chef knew how to cook a steak to order everything was the highest quality too bad that has all changed our extra cheese ham and mushroom had about the same amount of cheese as a frozen pizza the burger was mostly filler mcdonalds are better fries were awesome the two steaks that came to our table perfectly medium problem was that the guys ordered one rare and one well done they did not have fountain pop cans were brought out at a piece and the number one determiner that shows a complete lack of quality and respect for customersthey re fill heinz bottles with goodhost ketchup yuck", "our favourite tuesday night pizza spot its bogo on tuesdays staff is friendly pizzas are loaded with toppings cheese price is very fair ready in minutes from the time you order the restaurant is new clean highly recommended", "i have been going here as long as i can remember and great to see the new building opened up great selection on the menu as they have everything you could imagine unfortunately it might be its downfall as it is hard to be great at lots of things best thing would definitely the pizzas", "i come here when i am in the mood pizza its very good we get more than we can eat because it also makes for great lunch the next day i like the atmosphere the decor is tasteful and i like the music just loud enough to hear but does not make you speak louder to have a conversation", "i discovered this place in my entertainment book i was in the mood for some succulent comfort food and the stars aligned when i flipped to capital pizzas coupon although its a bit of a drive if you want a solid meal and its later in the evening they stay open until pm and serve food until am on weekends we ordered the steaks and they came grilled to perfection with large side orders of salad mashed potatoes and gravy capital has been around a long time over years and its known for its great steak and pizza i have not tried the za but ill be back the food is good and the price is reasonable its a family business and everyone in the clan seem to have a part in the enterprise whether its cooking folding napkins around cutlery or hanging out and keeping each other company the space is homey without much decor but the foods so good it does not really matter you do not have to gussy up to go out here and can loosen your belt to accommodate your hefty meal and no one will blink an eye if you eat late you may want to take a walk around the block before heading home to bed i felt so full after this meal i could barely get up from the table", "after deciding not to go back after their huge price increase without quality or service improvements i broke down and ordered some baked lasagne to go asian waitress said minutes till ready so i played vlts in lounge to kill time after waiting hour i went looking for waitress to find my order sitting at the cash register waitress said if customer is spending money on vlt how they do not interrupt against my better judgement yesterday i broke down again and tried to order a light lunch to go i asked for a lunch menu and was told they did not have one but that i would have to order off the regular menu but they would have to charge extra for take out when i asked why the asian waitress said she could not explain in english only that he would be madit was so ludicrous i told her i will not be back suddenly her english came back to her because she yelled at me all the way out the front door about their policy never again i really do not understand any good reviews this place would get", "this is an extortionist restaurant i asked if we can substitute olives for mushrooms the waitress said she can we get the bill back there is a dollar extra charge i ask her what its for and she said that the restaurant does not allow substitutions that it counts as extra i told her she never told us that and she lied and said that its written on the menu i checked the menu it was not written anywhere she proceeded to be very defensive and rude this was a clear attempt to try to secretly add extra money on the tab without our notice because even if this was a policy that was made known to us extra toppings cost not i highly discourage anyone from going who knows how much money they have stolen by lying to their customers", "really good place enjoyed the steak fries and steak sorry about the pic i dug in b i realized i needed a pic but yeah the steak was cooked perfectly well done like i ordered and the steak fries were nice and thick overall good experience since i just moved into the area will be going back again oh ya good service too we had the asian lady and she was quite nice", "this was my first time and i almost could not find it because the sign outside is too small however some members in our group of came here regularly and knew the menu inside out the wait staff were very warm and friendly and even the owner gave us special attention everyone enjoyed their selections which arrived in a timely manner we did not have room for dessert so i can not comment on that i would have liked to see more vegetarianvegan options on the menu prices were reasonable and food was good give it a try you will not be disappointed", "if you are going to go to any capital pizza in the city go to this one i am located near this one and the one on th but this location always has the most excellent service and the best food they renovated a while ago and the interior is honestly gorgeous the outside looks nothing like the inside does and i can imagine how easy it is to drive past this one and not even blink i find the service here to be above and beyond the owners care about the customers that come in and if you are a regular they will always ask you how you are doing how is life how is school or work they are really genuine people who care about the work that they do in the restaurant business the food here is good as well i am a huge fan of the poutine the wait for the food is not too bad either its about average for any restaurant this is a small hole in the wall place but its above and beyond all of the other capital pizza places i have been to if you are stuck and do not know where to go on a weeknight for dinner with your significant other or family or friends go here i highly recommend it", "love coming here i had the seafood lasagna and my wife had the baked spaghetti top notch great service and fred the owner is always put to greet everyone voted number pizza in alberta you would be a miss if you did not try it keep it classy capital", "first visit to this location i have eaten in the lounge of the ave location everything about this restaurant is dated but in a well maintained and charming way not in the lack of attention or caring way we were greeted immediately upon entry and seated menu is old school decor is old school piped in music is old school oddly comforting we ordered the mediterranean lasagna and the famous meat sauce pizza i figured if your in a place called capital pizza you should try the pizza and if it is famous pick that one my wife had the lasagna she came to the table starving after a long day and raved about how badly she needed that she gives it stars the pizza was super cheesey and the famous meat sauce lived up to my expectations our waitress was very attentive and i am guessing a family member this may become our new default neighbourhood eatery prices were certainly fare for the portion sizes i am betting they do not sell many deserts we will return we will bring friends", "i have not dined in for a while but recently have had pizza and lasagna for take out and the food is very good the service i have found to be very good as well", "filling pizza thick deep dish crust plenty of cheese well you can not complain about not enough cheese on these pizzas they load it up for sure the toppings are kind of sparse and because there is not enough you do not get most toppings in every bite i think my donald pizza had thin piece on each slice sparse amount of tomatoes with way too much onions to fill space it was not balanced at all kind of tasted like a onion pizza in my opinion the crust is tasty sauce minimal i think its okay for the price of for a medium pizza which is just about inches big and the same size as nooner pizza at boston pizza go on tuesdays and they have a decent buy get the second for off which is a great deal for sure its not my go to place i just wanted to try it out and medium pizza feeds people with smaller appetites overall it tasted decent was fresh and super hot so not complaining but not raving at all either must be hit or miss i guess", "hit and miss really sometime service is great with a little flair and sometimmes just perfunctory it is a nice quiet location to have an intimate meal with a friend or associate food is always consistently good and hot the beer is always available small booths and tables in a busy strip mall lot near gas station other side of intersection is scotiabank grey insurancebroker remax and japanese bakery", "love this restaurant we go from time to time and always enjoy our food for family get togethers when we do not feel like cooking we will order take out from here the owner helped us pack all the food to our car which was a nice friendly touch the greek salad has an amazing dressing which i am addicted to we will always keep coming back for the delicious food and great service", "great for a fast bite or a couple of drinks intimate small booths good food service depends on who is on family run not good for large groups as only one server central north area another restaurant nearby capital pizza and steaks not sure if connected business parking outside in strip mall near corner gas station", "delivery time is pretty quick the hawaiian pizza with chicken is not very tasty at this location the donair pizza is very good small sizes and higher prices compared to londonderry location", "this location is not really meant as an eat in location though that is what we did when we visited we ate the donair pizza and had cheese sticks and one person in our group drank a l bottle of diet pepsi the group enjoyed the food in general and while i did not really care for the donair pizza i liked the cheese sticks with the sweet white sauce the marinara was not that great for me but whatever what frustrated me is that there was a sign in the business saying that you could buy one pizza and get a second item for free with a l bottle of pop as one of those options but the staff member did not let me use that as my free option and instead asked me to order something else hence the cheese sticks this seems contradictory otherwise the service was reasonably quick and the seating area suited our needs", "of all the places in edmonton where i have had pizza not counting the authentic fire roasted italian pizzerias busters hands down has the best doughcrust its soft and spongy and the crust it self is covered with cheese i actually looked forward to the crust after a slice also their garlic cheesy breadstick and worth a try too really good price for all the items too", "had the best cheesy bread ever the owner was kind and extremely nice normally i do not give such a review but i was impressed with customer service and food", "busters is my new regular place for takeout delivery pizza forget pizza busters is the new hotness as will smith would say in a very dated cultural reference the pizza here is awesome and the cheesy garlic fingers with added bacon are killer when dipped in donair sauce they come with one order of donair sauce and one order of marinara sauce by default but they will usually switch the marinara for a second thing of donair sauce if you ask the chicken wings are good but they are a bit on the small side so unless you are craving wings id skip them but the pizza is fantastic especially the donair pizza and the meatsa pizza i have not tried their donairs or pasta yet but i am impressed with busters pizza and i am glad to see that the chain is expanding and growing in popularity", "overpriced for low quality not really tasty pizza for a chain this place disappoints but mind you i am not a fan of this chain either greasy soggy pizza with poor quality toppings not getting any return business from me the papa johns blocks away is way better if you are looking for a chain pizza place", "i asked for extra extra cheese pizza and all i got was a very thin layer of cheese when i told them it did not look very cheesy he said that is what it is will not be back here again", "what is with edmonton donair shops they do not open the pita and stuff the pita with meat cheese veggies and sauces instead you pay bucks for a donair burrito seriously ordered a donair with cheese why is cheese an option on a donair got a small pita rolled like a burrito with a bit of meat and veggies not sure there was any cheese in it came to gave the person a tried to give him self a tip and only give me back in change really disappointing will not be back over priced for tiny portions flavour was nothing special", "we ended up here late one night because our regular favourite donair shop nearby was only taking cash at the time we had the donair pizza and the bacon cheeseburger pizza both were delicious and i was impressed with the soft crust generous cheese to the edges and tasty toppings it was also great cold the next day we also ordered the cream cheese cinnamon sticks that were delicious and a lot bigger than i had expected as we were leaving we discovered they had delivery and will definitely be backorder delivery in the near future", "fantastic service from this pizza in regards to delivery delivery from this location has always been fast for us we had a more difficult experience going into this location to order a late night order but delivery has always been great", "i was in edmonton visiting and was hungry at my hotel so i decided to order some pizza and try something different and i was impressed the order online worked with no flaws and the pizza arrived quickly you can choose if you want sesame seeds or not and the pizza box is unique with levels to fit pizzas in the same box the delivery guy was fast and i will definitely be ordering again when i am in edmonton", "oh pizza why do you always satisfy our late night hunger cravings for you get a two medium topper pizzas pc wings and cans of pop that is feeding people for each you can also get whole wheat multigrain dough for no extra cost as a healthy alternative my friends and i usually pick up from this location the staff are fast and they maintain a clean working environment they have a long pizza menu and can take sometime to decide but italian stallion pizza thicks italian sausage slices with green peppers and mushrooms and bbq chicken pizza have been popular orders this location is open late am on fridays and saturdays making it one of the ideal places to order after you go out with some friends or want the house party to keep on going", "pizza is the perfect post bar binge food you know when you have been hanging out with friends drinking at the clubs on a friday or saturday night and you are suddenly starving when the clock strikes midnight pizza is more addictive than crack in times like these the cheaper the pizza is the better it tastes butive still had my standards i have always avoided pizza in the past because i thought it would be a little too ghetto for my taste youknowwhatimsayin i am not a pizza snob but most low cost za restaurants produce a product that tastes like papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 with tomato sauce yes i am talking about panago i have never been hungry or drunk enough to crave their food recently the ave location was hosting a th anniversary event where they were giving away free gift cards and yes i am one of those deadbeats that will show up when i can get something for nothing as i stood in line outside with the rest of the wide eyed salivating vultures who also showed up at the prospect of getting free food i could not help but be moved by the kind and amiable nature of the restaurants owner he came out to greet everyone and thank them for coming he even kept a calm demeanor when the owner of creative connoisseur a couple of doors down came out and started bitching at him because pizza huts his words customers were blocking the entrance to his door creative connoisseur had absolutely zero customers by the way apparently they sell beer and wine making supplies in a cool twist of irony there is a liquor depot located meters away from his store which could explain his bitterness i purchased two medium pizzas while i was there to support the establishment and thank them for the promotion and not violate yelps standards and practices i paid for my food speaking of the food their pizza is actually good damn fresh hot thick and hearty i do not know what hearty means when it applies to food or anything else for that matter but it seems to fit in this case i have been wrong about pizza this whole time the rest of the staff at this location are friendly too as well as fast and efficient there is no bars or clubs close to this restaurant either i did not mean to imply that their could only be enjoyed by the inebriated its just more fun", "this is the best location to get pizza always made perfect best customer service refuse to go to any other location this is the place to go", "they make very good pizza and have great customer service yet they are over priced the pizzas here are far more expensive than dominos which is much better in relations to delivery taste and choice of pizzas", "i walk in i am second in line its not busy at all cashier take order of the person in front of me while i check out their deals when she is done she says thank you to the person in front of me and leave for the back of the restaurant and i am here at the cash dangling like an idiot", "great food amazing customer service and even better prices definitely the best lebanese restaurant around", "quality pizza and dessert worth visiting edmonton for the toppings on the donair pizza melted in my mouth i may visit one more time before we leave", "awesome chicken shawarma nice location i am not very used to lebanese food but i am staying at a friends house until i am able to move into my apartment and this happened to be nearby and within walking distance very glad i went the chicken shawarma looks and tastes amazing the location also seemed like a very pleasant place to dine in at clean and roomy but i was there right around closing time and needed to get back to my friends place", "love this place awesome food great service and lovely spacious decor the rotisserie chicken is amazing and reminds me of my days in the middle east definitely recommend", "one if the best mediterranean food i have tried in edmonton really authentic and everything tasted great the portions were also quite generous i loved their patio very spacious place so you could eat without worrying about being in contact with too many people in the midst of a pandemic they also offered welcome coffee which tasted amazing loved the while experience and will be back again", "i came in for a lunch meeting my companion was late so it allowed me to watch how the place was run for a few minutes what i saw was a comfortable restaurant where people came to enjoy the company of others as much as to enjoy the excellent food the restaurant is quite large there is seating for about with extra tables outside the counter and till are off centre which makes the large display cooler the first think you see when you come in there is nothing on display however which takes away from the ambience although bags upon bags of cheese do look pretty cool maybe if they were stacked in a decorative way my companion was here when it was an italian restaurant and you can tell it was set up for something else the menu is on screens above the counter or available in print most ordered at the counter although they do have table service as i was sitting for some time waiting for my companion they were kind enough to check on me twice even bringing me free coffee i did not have the heart to tell them i do not drink coffee as it was such a kind gesture i offered it to my friend when she arrived she said it was a good the menu consists of for pizzas salads wraps pita pies fatayer and various platters the highlight seems to be the rotisserie chicken i went for the chicken shawarma and made it a combo so i could review their fries i enjoyed it and my friend enjoyed her dish if your looking for a nice place for a quite meeting or a quick lunch you would be happy hear", "not much of a thin crust fan but these pizzas are awesome freshly made an different toppings to choose from only pizza plac we go to eat very friendly service i might add", "this location of famoso offers good service the food is about more expensive than it should be but the swish surroundings have to be paid for somehow recommended", "i can not believe i forgot to review this place i went here for dinner about a month ago and it was so damn good lots of juicy toppings nice thin crust that was not swimming in grease and wine oh my such lovely wine and pizza together top it off with a little gelato for dessert and i have a new favorite in the park", "if you are looking for a great non oily pizza this is the place to go the crust is thin and very flavourful the gorgonzola salad is a good companion for the pizza and makes you fell better you are it just eating carbs the tomato soup is a good starter is light and just the right amount of bitterness and sweetness", "amazingly delicious casual environment with great service perfect for lunch or takeout bring the kids my favorite restaurant", "disclaimer pizza snob alert i have been to southern italy a few times and recently spent some time in naples and fell in love with marinara pizzas they are simple and delicious but require a few things wood fired thin crust flavourful sauce since there is no cheese and fresh basil famoso markets itself as the most traditional neapolitan pizza around so i thought i would try the most traditional neapolitan pizza there was honestly it was a let down the crust was good but slightly undercooked the basil was sparse and did not taste very fresh but its march in canada so that is fair for a marinara to be good the sauce has to carry it and it just did not it was too bland the worst part was the garlic there was an overwhelming amount and it just dominated the whole pizza it was like the cook used a garlic press and placed massive globs of mashed garlic all over it so one bit was just sauce that was a bit too bland then the next was an explosion of garlic i love garlic but eating a whole clove in one bit is too much for me famoso really tries but when in canada ill probably just stick to the greasy cheesy pies that we do so well here", "i am so in love with this place the pizza is amazing i am convinced people who say they do not like it just have not found the right pizza for them the staff are super friendly and helpful sometimes there can be a bit of a wait for your pizza if its packed but if speed is a huge issue for you you can always call ahead and pre order which works well for lunches the pizza is true italian pizza and delicious", "i went to this place for dinner pizza was good caprese salad was reasonable gelato was ok price was a little on the upper side on my point of view service was really bad the lady taking orders was not willing to help this region has so many options so many restaurants i am not going there again", "my last visit here as a celebratory lunch for completing the last day of classes was a bit of a let down our waitressserver genuinely gave the feeling like she did not want to work there and treated us as if she was trying to get as out as soon as possible even though we were nothing but courteous to her as we believed she was just having a long daybad day that being said i will not let just one waitress decide how i feel towards an entire establishment the pizza is great here its a unique experience having to fold it in my opinion it has one of the better sauces i have tasted in a while accompanied with the cheeses they use albeit i am more on the sweeter side of taste when it comes to food the pizza may not always be as filling as i want it to be but its never any less delicious as i expect it to be when it comes to the gelatofloats they can be a bit expensive considering what you get", "i believe it was this location had a work party years back pretty decent pizza i was never able to discern which pizza joint is the best its pretty hard to mess up pizza right anyways great service and good times", "this place is not my cup of tea mainly for the food my husband and i went to famoso for dinner on a friday night its kind of unique how you go up to the counter to order rather than have a server come to you the service was great and fairly quick too i ordered a smoked salmon pizza and my husband had a sandwich i will stick with americanized pizza that is for sure the slightly charred thin crust pizza which is apparently how traditional pizza should be did not taste good and there was no tomato sauce or cheese on it either just slices of smoked salmon capers and some sort of white sauce drizzled on maybe i just need to try a different pizza but i am in no hurry to back", "nothing to complain about always great food service never disappointed my favourite location although never have had a bad experience at any of the other locations", "famoso is one of the best pizza joints i have ever been to the quattro formaggi is my go to but the hawaiian is also a solid choice now onto one of the best items at famoso the caesar salad hands down one of the best things i have ever had the dressing is flavoured so well and the prosciutto crisps and grana padano are such a great touch to make the salad even more authentic i could eat that salad over and over id be surprised if you have not been to a famoso but if you have not what are you waiting for", "over the years this has remained one of my favourite restaurants it consistently has amazing staff and amazing quality having now been to several different locations over the city i can safely say that this is hands down one of the best locations in the edmonton area seriously there is a difference", "amazing pizza the springsummer features are incredible and are a welcome surprise to their standard if a little limited menu the drinkswine selection is perfect for a pizzeria and the gelato is insane if you are tired of the greasy gut bombs from other places definitely give them a go", "the food here is too good the flavours are simple but jumps off the plate the espresso is amazingly smooth the service is fast and friendly over all its a great experience for lunch or dinner they do have a outside patio which is also really nice during the warm weather definitely check them out if you want some great italian pizza", "best neapolitan pizza this side of naples fabulous hand tossed brick oven baked thin crust pizza ever famoso imported their pizza brick oven straight from naples but that is not the only imported thing they import most of their ingredients directly from italia flour olive oil sun dried tomatoes mmmarvelous pizza is not the only thing on their menu they have wonderful salads and delicious baked sandwiches if you like soup their house speciality will impress you a wonderful tomato bisque with cream and feta cheese it is a little on the spicy side but you keep wanting more a very filling choice you can also choose a pizetta with a side the pizetta is a half size pizza of your choice which you can order individually or with soup salad or sandwich their desserts will also not disappoint you fabulous locally made gelato panna cotta dolce and banana and affogatto i quite enjoy their chai latte it is a nice surprise and can be ordered with skim milk the menu has regular features but also has seasonal ones that change they have a wine club you can join and every time you purchase a glass of wine it is recorded these add up and you can earn free vino can not beat that be advised that at lunch and supper time the lineups to this restaurant can be long come a little earlier if you can once seated service is quick and friendly reservations only if a party of or more", "very good pizzas are delicious and the prices are good nutella pizza is not as great as i thought it would be it would be better if it was made with more of a sweet dough instead of just pizza dough but all in all very good pizza", "great service best out of all locations i have visited clean and quiet atmosphere large tables to accomodate families and large parties as well always get the quattro formagioyum yum yum the tiramisu is fab too try to save room", "first time at famoso was awesome i actually liked the sophia lauren sandwich rather then the pizza both vegetarian very reasonable prices and always made to order no problems with seating ordering and getting what you pay for try the gelato", "very yummy pizza the caesar salad was done in a unique way and tasted very nice as well i am not a huge fan of most thin crust pizzas too crispy so i was not sure what to expect i was pleasantly surprised when i went here though the crust is very good its definitely not crispy only on the edges there is a nice balance between crust and toppings its a bit odd how you get a table then have to leave the table to order at least they bring the food to you i guess i will be back", "love this place their neapolitan style pizza is on point and service is fast they even gave my toddler a little ball of dough to entertain her until the food came one time they messed up an order and they gave me off my next visit our favourites are the vesuvio and siciliana style is very reminiscent of the pizza in italy", "we went for dinner last night it was extremely busy and we had a year old with us they give the little ones dough to play with which is great we ended up waiting quite some time and when our pizza came it was not cooked properlywe have eaten there before without a problem it is great and the gf crust is amazing we ended up having to leave due to little one and the long wait but without expecting it the owner approached us to say sorry for the wait and he had taken the pizzas off our bill to conclude we were satisfied with every thingsometime things happen out of a restaurant s control they solved the problem very well", "first off this is real pizza not that gross greasy pie shaped stuff you get from americanized pizza places this is the real deal and holy pancakes batmanits good i started with the caprese salad which was dare i say erotic thick slices of mozzarella with perfectly ripened tomatoes all swimming in balsamic vinaigrette on a bed of greens so good my eyes literally rolled to the back of my head my pollo pizza which was roasted chicken with artichoke hearts and peppers can only be described as what i think zombies taste when they eat brains just so good you can not stop until its all gonethey should definitely consider making that some sort of awesome slogan for the longest time i thought that i would forever hate pizza but this is no more thank you famoso for showing me what real pizza is now i shall never look back so long pizza little ceasars and other generic garbage i think this has a huge thing to do with the fact that this is thin sliced which is healthier and easier to eat and you get to roll it into cute little pizza rolls how quaint the prices are pretty steep but in the end i think worth it because everything is made fresh and all the ingredients are of great quality and some even flown in all the way from italy for more authenticity the also have nutella pizza and other desserts derived from nutella which is bad for meas i am addicted to nutellaargh go to famoso and i promise you will never look at pizza the same way again oh and do not forget to sample some fine italian wine like how can you resist i can not", "i ordered the capricciosa pizza and it was simply exquisite the high quality olive oil and fresh basil on this particular pizza that also comes with mushrooms ham and artichoke hearts make for one amazingly delicious slice after another service was also fantastic shout out to our server that night alexa place for being so helpful ps i love the wine specials", "i have never had a bad pizza here favourites include bbq chicken and funghi pizzas tiramisu is a must try service is usually prompt here", "awesome food great service very quick and excellent for lunch i highly recommend this location for lunch", "outstanding service kudos to all wait staff and cooks mozzarella balls are delicious and definitely a new fav pizza is cooked to perfection and service is very quick and efficient i will definitely be back", "simply the most creative and delicious pizza i have ever had strongly recommend you are not simply eating a pizza or a meal you are enjoying an art", "my daughter suggested we go here when we visited her i tried my first bloody caesar which is a bloody mary made with clamato it was good but not any better than what i am used to the pizzas though were delicious we tried a couple of different varieties and we all shared the server was friendly and helpful", "famoso is definitely one of my favourite chains around i have been to almost all the locations around here and i can always trust it to be consistent no matter what location i choose to go to last night my mom and i visited the sherwood park location for the first time in a while we were kind of early for dinner it was around pm and there was only one other table in there when we arrived our server was alexa and she was an absolute sweetheart she made great conversation with us and provided fantastic service they have a great happy hour menu on from pm pm and again from close and we definitely made good use of that menu i warned alexa that although there were only of us we were going to order enough food for people she laughed and told us to bring it on let us see if i can remember everything we had the famoso salad is a must have everytime were here the flavours are delicious alexa told us that she adds avocados to hers and i think ill have to try that next time cauliflower and artichoke dip this was really tasty though probably my least favour dish of the night the smoked mozza added a flavour that just did not do it for me meatballs my favourite these are a mixture of beef pork and ricotta cheese absolutely delicious mediterranean flatbread another staple on the menu long strips of baked pizza dough with tzatziki and hummus to dip it into i am not even a big fan of hummus but this is great bruschetta always delicious the crustinis are not over toasted so you can easily bite into them the balsamic reduction adds a nice sweetness this is a nice inexpensive evening out and awesome that you can bring the whole family they even bring little balls of pizza dough for the kids to play with", "so here is a disclaimeri do not usually promote chain restaurants however they have their place if you want consistency and no surprises often chains are good for big family dinners where no one can decide on what to eat or meeting new people for the first time and you are unsure on what to choose they are the safe bet i have been to famosos times in the last month to test this theory out and i was pleasantly surprised i ordered two times the roasted cauliflower pizza extra virgin olive oil garlic oregano fior di latte roasted seasoned cauliflower green olives toasted almonds gorgonzola and grana padano topped with honey house made chili oil and a lemon wedge i really hope they keep this one on the menu this pizza is a really lovely balance of spicy and sweet i also was very impressed with the antipasto platter marinated olives fior di latte mozzarella topped with pistachio pesto sliced italian meats arugula salad served with garlic flatbread the platter was decent but the marinated olives were excellent my husband ordered the siciliana oven roasted italian sausage italian ham prosciutto twice and enjoyed it both times i also love the fire roasted tomato bisque rich full of complex tomato and basil flavours this is a warm hug the thing that did not work for me was the cauliflower artichoke dip roasted seasoned cauliflower artichokes cream cheese cheddar and smoked mozzarella oven baked served with tortilla chips and garlic flatbread it was fairly bland our servers each time were attentive and quick with the food this is a place that i would be willing to revisit", "its good its good we shared a caesar salad which was very tasty a bit average but good we also murdered a pepperoni and roasted mushroom pizza between us and that was also good littlest kid had spaghetti and meatballs which i ended up finishing because kids and that was good also good the oldest kid had a ham and pineapple pizza it was good good stuff gelato for dessert good also good but the wine is not good do not have the wine not a fan probably should have had a coffee instead or water not good and i am going to have to chop off a half a star for bringing the food for the adults well ahead of the food for the kids like five minutes ahead super not good my friends parents hear me on this one i mean overall good good food good service that is what counts but the little things around the edges were not ideal and the meal ended up being spectacularly expensive considering all the little annoyances that compounded and nothing was capital g great", "love love love this restaurant i eat here all the time and have never had any issues great atmosphere and beautifully designed space service has always been great food has always been awesome and the food always arrives quickly i have a bunch of allergies and as soon as i mentioned that they were quick to produce an allergen menu and helped me figure out what i could have they also made sure to prepare my food seperately and i have never had a reaction after eating there if you have allergies you know how hard it is to eat out perfect for a date night or a fun night our with friends", "my wife loves it here she from the fire roasted tomato bisque to the caprese salad do not forget the pizza service has changed from what it originally was and we like it there is a great atmosphere for the whole family at a very affordable price treat yourself to some gelato on the way out", "i love famoso this location is close to home and the staff are wonderful service is great for dine in and take out i prefer dine in because i find the pizza gets soggy fast if we take out but that is not their fault their cauliflower artichoke dip and tomato bisque are basically a good group in itself my only dislike that i have ordered is the marinated olives not the antipasto platter maybe its the coriander and oil marinade not sure but its definitely not for me everything else though i love famoso is my happy place", "good pizza place they cook their pizza differently by cooking there pizza by a fire oven for only seconds authentic italian pizza at its best my only complaint is that the last two times i went there the bottom of the pizza was black this really ruined the experience for me has anyone else had this happen", "cavoletti pizza is very good might actually be my favourite pizza its the right right amount of sweet and salty we also tried the cauliflower artichoke dip it was also very good accept their portions are way out to lunch you get a massive container of artichoke dip and four pieces of garlic flatbread so if you order this pick up a bag of tortilla or pita chips to help eat most of the dip", "its just up the road from us and although we could not get the online order system to work our pizzas were topped on a dense satisfying crust i was stuffed and satisfied more than panago even though the pies are waaaaay smaller they make up for size in dense ness we tried the chicken garlic parm and an everything one both tastey do not need dips nice to support the little local guy much better than pizza in vancouver point for edmonton", "ok so i am not usually big on reviewing a place that is take outdelivery however i am posting this because pizza came out with a gluten free pizza i have always thought their wings were ok and their gf pizza meh i ordered hawaiin and pepperoni the pepperoni one well the dough was barely brown but the toppings burnt the hawaiian was better good topics but the bottom of the crust was pasty white i really think they need to revise their gf crust recipe in the meantime i will keep on ordering from somewheres else or make my own", "pizza has not been the same anywhere since they change their breadsticks and dippin sauces their pizza is too much dough", "it will fill you up but do not expect a gastronome delight it arrives hot and fast so when you star stuffing it down your head you think its great then when the slices cool off a bit you start realizing that the crust tastes like cardboard and the toppings are bland and canned i love to eat cold pizza the next day but not this one if you are on a budget there probably is not a cheaper pie around", "excellent service at this store they went out of their way to be sure my order was fulfilled properly pizza was great too thank you", "we really wanted pizza one night so we grabbed the yellow pages and made some calls most of the places we called were going to charge us between for medium pizzas and delivery are you serious was my reaction to all of them finally we called pizza and thank goodness for them our medium pizzas and hot wings and delivery came to under and the driver was at out door in minutes i kid you not we timed him it was crazy and the pizza was good it was classic and it tasted great since this experience we have ordered from them twice more and every time they are great if you are looking for delivery and not delissio go with pizza they are a great deal they are fast and they taste great", "hot fresh and the correct order did not take long especially on a sunday afternoon the funnel cake sticks are super delicious but needs something like cream cheese icing", "visited this location for a pick up and the gentlemen at the counter was very friendly polite and efficient", "wow the chicken sandwich was very good everyone is jumping on the chicken sandwich bandwagon but they nailed it", "have been ordering pizza regularly from this location from the last months and each time has been wonderful pack with toppings and delicious made us a fan of pizza then we ordered on the weekend and we waited and it did not come then when i called they said it was for pickup and not delivery although wed requested delivery anne from the phone line was very helpful and said if it was cold or anything was wrong not to hesitate to call back and they would fix it when it arrived burnt and not near the quality of the previous pizzas i requested a replacement anne was very helpful and professional said they would get it to us right away what a relief after waiting over an hour i realized it was not arriving again so i called back they said the store had canceled the replacement and no pizza was coming so wed waited since pm for pizza and it was pm and all we had was burnt pizza to eat worst customer service i have ever had from a pizza place then we thought if we ordered during the week the quality would be better when the driver arrived he tried to get out of bringing the pizza up to the door making excuses finally when he did bring it up he made comments about how we complained last time and how his boss could not afford it i am sorry but when spending on pizza i can not afford it to be substandard quality and burnt very disappointing customer service very dishonest and cheap never had this issue with dominos when pizzas came not quality they replaced it no questions asked and the drivers were never rude about it this was not our problem they messed up the order twice and making it our problem is unacceptable", "nd pizza that we asked for with extra sauce and not burnt even dominos puts more sauce on than this without asking for extra also many burnt toppings terrible quality from this location would not recommend not what you would expect for worth of pizza", "ordering from a different pizza now one that actually makes quality pizza see the photos for what a quality pizza looks like exact same order same crust toppings etc", "is it a convenience store is it a pizza place perhaps where intoxicated people stumble to for a quick bite honestly i did not know what to think when i first walked in it has all of the convenience store essentials plus some i mean they have slushies soft serve milk shakes flavours of cheezies i have never seen before then you go over to the counter and there is the menu pizza donairs poutine butter chicken i decided on pizza as that is what they are known for i thought to myselfok this is going to be some greasy for kind of place where the dough is cardboard and they are stingy on the toppings nope this is some of the freshest pizza i have ever had it was not greasy the crust was the perfect widthnot too thick and not too thin good amount of cheese fresh cooked veggies its like the ultimate homemade pizza its a unique spot and i will definitely be back to try more off of their menu the only criticism is the pricing its a little steep for what you get for a small which is and about slices", "we order from here quite a lot because the large pizzas on the for deal are so worth it because they leave us with tons of leftovers our favorite is by far the donair pizza we have also tried the chicken bacon ranch meh three meat hubby loves this one i actually find it a bit too meaty and the bbq chicken i like this one hubby says its just ok we have also had their donairs which are really yummy we have tried their caesar salad and it was not that great i can get a bagged caesar from the grocery store that is cheaper and tastes better i also love grabbing a slushie with ice creammilkshake mixed in its super yummy i have noticed they also have chocolate and vanilla soft serve and ever since mcdonalds got rid of their chocolate soft serve i have missed getting twisty cones so ill have to grab one of those sometime great selection of drinks and a pretty good selection of candies i love having this place so close to our home for treats and a quick dinner solution", "i am actually surprised at how good this pizza is considering its from a convince store i have zero complaints i had the hawaiian pizza and battered mushrooms with tzatziki the pizza had lots of flavour and tasted fresh and was not greasy", "this place is nothing to get excited for i had their garlic fingers with sweet sauce golden wings and onion rings garlic fingers were very amateur no flavour wings were decent i expected the onion rings to look like the pic they had on skip the dishes thin crunchy batter but they were thick and soggy i would never order from here again", "family owned neighbourhood convenience store and fast food takeoutdelivery pizza donairs burgers casual indian food etc has everything you would need in a convenience store including a slurpy machine gift cards to various merchants bags of ice and coffee no gas pumps outside the parking lot has limited spaced and is wicked tight especially during the mornings and after work and when the day care parents show up and treat the parking lot like a monster truck rally i have ordered pizza donairs and poutines from here previously and they were not the best i have ever had not sure why a lot of these reviews are expecting a neighbourhood convenience store to pump out gourmet pizzas but they also were not the worst overall i have been satisfied with the food orders the deliveries were accurate and timely the prices for items in the store and for the food orders are a bit higher than you would find at comparable establishments but it is a family owned place that probably does not purchase in volumes so there is economics and what not for those that understand such things the service here is so so sometimes you will get someone who does not know what they are doing with the till gift card machine or the lottery tickets but overall you can get what you need", "easily the best buffalo chicken pizzas i have ever had all other types are good too two large pizzas for a decent price leaves us full with lots of leftovers even catered our midnight lunch at our wedding for a fair price highly recommend", "i am guessing that this is a pretty new location but i do not really find myself out that way too often so i am not sure i have to say i was pretty impressed though when your pregnant best friend says she wants dominos you find a dominos lol i ordered online and put in a specific pick up time i was pretty surprised by the size of this place usually its just a very small interior with a pickup window but this was fairly large still just a pickup area but there were two tills and a pop display it was also really open so you could see them making your pizza the coolest part was the big tv screen that shows the status of your order and how long until it is ready although now that i think about it that screen had my full name on it so what is to stop somebody else from coming in and looking at the screen to see who is order is ready and then just taking my order well they would still have to pay for it i suppose so maybe its not that big of a deal anyway the staff were really friendly and my pizza was ready minutes before the time i had requested", "never really expected much out of a drunken pizza order but picture this a discount boston pizza crust is awesome even the day after no sogginess at all the wings were sent with the sauce separate which made them still hot and fresh all in all going to ordering back soon only slightly downside is when you have drunken munchies you do not get to fully appreciate this cures a hangover good though a recommended", "hands down best dimonos pizza in edmonton i drive across town to eat here staff is very friendly and professional toppings are fresh and plentiful what more can you ask", "walked in at to place an order for dinner two men were sitting on the counter talking they looked at me then kept on talking i waited and waited then i walked out and came back in hoping to spur some kind of customer service they looked to see why the door chimed then left me standing there again waiting finally a lady runs from the back kitchen to take my order another lady is busy making pizzas the men continue to sit there and talk while the ladies work the counter and prepare the orders i said to the ladies you do all the work while those two just sit there they say yes and look down while still working", "i have only had great experiences with them fast delivery and fast pickup times if you like dominos then this is a great location", "way cheaper then boston pizza and way tastier great gluten free crust as well i recommend the pacific veggie pizza the pepperoni is really nice too and do not even get me started on the pizza bread delicious got to love dominos", "i received a flyer in the mail for pizza hut which promoted the cheese stuffed crust and the triple treat box among other specials with the exception of the pizza of the day specials on the back page none of the other specials are noted to be online only i was refused to be able to take advantage of any of the specials in person instead i ordered a special off the menu which ended up being of poor quality i have photos before leaving the location i noticed the flyer also had the early week specials and asked if they were still available to be ordered as a walk in customer when i was told yes i questioned why they were in the same flyer and not marked any differently than the specials i was refused but i could order them at the counter as a walk in in short i was informed the supervisor could have placed my order and discounted it but he would have been questioned about it best of all if these specials are for online only why are there a stack of these flyers kept at the counter by the cash register for customers to viewtake very poor service", "today was a blustery chilly day and i did not feel like getting dressed or brushing my teeth or drawing on eyebrows so i basically ate everything in my fridge and then ran out of food at dinner time what to do i was obviously too gross to go to the store so a pizza guy must be found i ordered pizza hut online and then basically just sat and waited and stared at my front door for the next minutes i got a phone call i was scared to answer it in case the pizza guy said there was a mistake and i was not allowed to have pizza but no the pizza guy wanted directions sure its a new area and his gps was not working so i gave him turn by turn directions which was like turn left turn right and my house is nd on the right and the porch light is on its blue you can not miss it he missed it he called another minutes later lost sure he was on the same street that i live on but he could not find it i talked him through driving north and looking out his window on the left to see the house where i was now flicking the porch light on and off profusely he drove by i stayed on the line with him for minutes and he drove around and around and ignored me when i said i just saw you drive by why did not you stop now i know what you are thinking why did not i just go out into the middle of the road in my jim jams with no bra mad hair dirty teeth yesterdays makeup weeping down my face and flag the sucker down oh it was cold out so finally on the th try i yelled at him to look up and see the blinking light of the blue house nd on the right and i finally got my cold congealed pizza i said thanks for the cold pizza and he had no excuse aside from being a millennial who depends soley on gps and can not be bothered to use his brain my brain on the other hand is fine i got extra pizzas to toss in the freezer for my next pizza emergency by the time i run out and need pizza again this guy will have moved onto another job like uber", "i have noticed that the pizza from this location is a bit different than the meadowlark location since the callingwood location is more convenient for us we were ordering from here the last two times the outside crust has gotten larger meaning that there is no sauce or topping to the edge so it is dry and usually not eaten as this has happened more than once they must make their pizzas like this on purpose at least pizza hut now offers buy one get one for price everyday to compete with other pizza chains i suggest going to a different location unless you like dry crust", "just got an order delivered chicken alfredo too much pepper not enough chicken or sauce will not be ordering pasta from here again just lost yourself a good customer", "first off their debit machine forces you to leave a tip unless you push the down button which is hard to find and understand what to do we payed for dips and did not get them called the number because we could not find the store number anywhere we did not get a receipt so then we wait on hold finally get a human and they put us through to the store on hold again after being moved around and on hold for about minutesfinally get through to the store and let them know we did not get our dips we payed for we were told that they would bring them right away we were not even offered an apology out of curiosity i started a timer minutes later we received our dips our pizza was cold because we waited to eat it thinking they would bring them like they said right away i phoned again to let them know that this is unacceptable customer service they offered me a credit for my next order but it honestly will not be worth it to me i will not order from them again", "i am stunned that i am giving this review to not only a place i have only ever ordered delivery from and a good mins away but also a place i have learn is in a gas station i have ordered pizza and fried chicken from on numerous occasions and its always been effing delicious chicken is very similar to kfc but crispier and the pizza is great killer crust that is i guess regular pan in terms of thickness but has always been well cooked well seasoned and super effing tasty if this is the food that a gas station can pump out then i am all for it ill order from here over and over and over", "although it is hard to spotwhen you do find it it is one of my favourite pizza places close to me their pizza is very nice and does not take long for them to bring it outgood for the price you pay", "best pizza well made with good toppings very generous of them to serve two large pizza free for fort mcmurray residents we are very grateful to them for serving us free fresh and delicious pizza well made to out choice", "honestly one of the best pizza places edmonton has to offer the meat lovers and veggie pizzas are to die for the owners even go to a pizza convention in vegas every year the price is also fair in comparison to other local joints check it out people", "this is a little known place on th ave and just off th street and it is pretty good its located in the same complex as the husky gas station so its kind of hard to spot but they make good pizza i have only had the pepperoni pizza and its nice and crispy not too thick they must do something special with their dough because it has a nice taste to it it could just be extra greasy either way they are doing something right", "my wife recently wanted to try a new pizza place and did we ever find a jem amazing pizza fresh toppings and the most delicious crust i have ever had everyone must try pizza wonderful owners that seem have a close relationship with all of their customers it was beautiful to observe", "anyone living in millwoods should really give this pizza try its in the husky gas station on th ave super unassuming but delicious pizza its not too greasy really fast and has awesome toppings the crust is really good crispy on the outside but soft on the inside when i just want a pizza i can go to this place and get one in about minutes no fuss this place was closed when i moved into my house but reopened under a new owner and is a really great little gas station", "i ordered small pizzas from this place not a custom order but what was on the menu after hours of waiting i finally received the order of the pizzas were cold i mean you could get more heat off a corpse and the other one was lukewarm i thought i would give them a chance try something new and go by the reviews i will never order from here again", "i have to downgrade my review unfortunately i think that anyone who reads my reviews knows that i have no problem rating a i just can not say that about this place at this point while the pizza is good every time i come in it feels like people are bothered to serve me for some reason seriously i get the meanest looks from the staff and i have no idea why they look at me like i am the stupidest most annoying person ever they sigh when i bring things to the front counter or order pizza recently its happened every single time i have come in for pizza andor something from husky not really sure what changed the worst part about it is that when i come in with my roommate they will be nice and smile to her but their demeanour instantly changes with me i am not kidding they will go from instant smile to completely stone faced it is absolutely bizzare its hard not to take personally when i see good service happening to others but not to me i am a customer just like anyone else there to spend money the least you can do is treat me like an effing human being i have been putting off writing this review for as long as possible but i will not be returning to this husky simply because i feel really uncomfortable coming here i am sorry for bothering you so much with my patronage i would rather go the extra mile to the macs in near millbourne mall its too bad because the pizza really is delicious", "do not be deceived pizza is located in a husky gas station might seem strange but do not let it deter you from trying it out quick cheap good pizza its one of our top three go to pizza places id give it a solid as far as pizza goes menu offers dips sides and chicken too", "pizza is by far in my mind the best and most tastiest pizza out therepizza is not so greasy like almost every other and is topped out with great quality cheesetoppings and oh yathe crust", "doing a quick re review on this place to ensure that everyone in millwoods is aware of the fact that this amazing pizza place is in the husky on th i swear everytime i order a pizza here i am blown away by the fact that they produce the most delicious pizzas so happy that i can just walk over here and grab an amazing pizza for such a great price and so quick its still as good as the first time", "i ordered pizza and wings from these guys online i called after an hour to see what was taking so long i was told that its on the way an hour later still no pizza my house is about a min drive away its been two hours and still nothing not even a phone call or email then i ordered from panago instead and got my pizza mins later", "standard donair only offered regular toppings but they did give me wcheese for the price of a regular found the sauce was not sufficient for the entire donair so the last or bites were dry the meat was spicy as well so some may not like it if you are in the area and really need a donair this will do", "come here if you want to eat your donair with vegetables that still have the upc sticker on it and have the meat fall out because it was cut up into small pieces and loosely wrapped i will spend my money elsewhere that actually puts some effort into making their food", "this place is close to where i work and they had guys out delivering free pizzas to advertise in the area the pizza they dropped off had pepperoni mushrooms and green peppers on it and showed up pretty hot everyone in the office had a slice and everyone said it was pretty decent the only complaint was they were a bit light on the sauce but everyone loved the cheese pretty solid stuff", "best donair i have ever had in canada anybody who prefers thicktasteless beef with loaded sauce should really rethink about what a decent donair means the cut is so delicate and i feel like the meat has been marinated in the sweet sauce very different than a lot of other places spectacular addicted", "the donairs here are great this is the first time we ordered here without using skip the dishes we went in this time for pick up and the lady was wearing a mask around her neck she then proceeded to make our food without one as well had i known that this whole time we were ordering here they were not following covid precautions we probably would not be eating here"], "meta": ["Pizza 73", "Pizza 73", "Pizza 73", "Pizza 73", "Pizza 73", "Pizza 73", "Pizza
